Welcome back. We had mic issues. A little bit of interesting timing, especially with free speech. We're going to try to [indiscernible] it on you. So my appreciation for you guys hang in time with me, and we are very quickly returning to the conversation that you all want. I'm sitting here with the CEO of Rumble himself, Mr. Chris Pavlovski. We're going to dive into what happened in the last quarter, the last year, but most importantly, the things to look forward to in the world of alternative tech and social media as we're getting into the year 2024. Chris, how are you doing today?\\nDoing great. But I'm going to go to the chat and make sure my mic is working first. One is in the chat if the mic is working better now, two is in the chat, if it's not, I'm going to wait to see what everyone says before we start diving into it for the third time here.\\nI could see those ones in chat.\\nAll right, it looks like we're good. Chat's posting ones so we'll kick it off. So thank you for coming a [ longboat ]. Really excited to be here. By the way, I'm always looking at the chat. I'm keeping my eyes on it and not on my phone, looking at what the community is saying. But super happy you're here. Obviously, this is -- for me, personally, and I think I can speak on behalf of a lot of -- everyone at Rumble, this is probably the most exciting time to be here. We've built a real business. We have real products. It's the most exciting time across the Board. 2023 was the year that we were going to build all these things. So there was a lot of stuff saying, hey, we're going to build a cloud. We're going to build an advertising center. \\nWe're going to compete against Google here and competing against Amazon there. But now it's a reality. Coming into the first quarter of '24, we're now like in a real reality where we have something that is really special, something that like we've done with such little capital compared to other tech companies out there. But such little capital, we've accomplished so much in the last year. And I think that's like just a massive testament to the team, the engineers, the whole team as a whole, it's just been an incredible accomplishment on our side. So I've never been more excited and more happy to be here. So thanks for coming here today.\\nI appreciate it. And I have to say from an outsider looking in -- we sat here and had these conversations where you're saying, hey, the calendar year 2024 is going to be the Super Bowl year. I don't know if you saw the stream this morning. I won my Rumble football jersey in celebration of that. But you've told me that, hey, we're going to make Rumble Cloud work. We're going to make RAC work. We're going to sign bigger deals. \\nAnd then all of a sudden, in real time, we're sitting here, the cloud is live. RAC is picking up momentum and you're signing big partnerships with the likes of Barcel Sports just to name one of the many. So the fact that you have been saying it out loud, and now we're sitting here with the delivery of it, obviously, hats off to you and hats off to the rest of the team. But you did say something there that I thought was interesting, and you hinted out a little bit in the earnings call when you're talking about other tech and the money they're spending and you brought up Reddit. And the money that they've spent on research and design. \\nAnd I think the number you cited was $400 million. And it got me thinking, so I researched it. I had some time sitting there. And over the past 3 years, it's actually in excess of $1 billion. Did you know that?\\nI looked at Reddit quite a bit. But I'm going to back up just a second here, like speaking about the cloud, we built a cloud that alone, like I sit a step back and I look at that, we built an entire cloud that is now available to the public, not just for Rumble, but for everyone. Microsoft has a cloud. Amazon has a cloud. Google has a cloud. They spend billions and we did it. And we did it with such a small team, and it's just like we have it now. It's real. And going to Reddit, $1 billion, I didn't know -- I knew $400 million this -- for the last trailing 12 months, I believe it is, that they spent on R&D. $430 million more around there. That's more than we raised going public. And they don't have a cloud, they don't. \\nThey have essentially a form, a very complicated form, a large form, the largest, but a form. It's been around for almost 2 decades. They haven't made money in what -- ever. Have they ever made money? I don't know, but I don't think so. They're losing a ton of money, and they're spending $400 million on R&D. And I don't know what's that -- what that could be on. How is that even possible? Like at this company, we built cloud. We built an advertising center. We built a video platform, live streaming products like -- and we've done it for fractions of the cost that any of these big tech companies do anything at and in a fraction of the time, and I just -- I think that's like really underappreciated of how amazing this team is and how much further along we are than most people thought we would be at this point in time. \\nLike it's only been like 1.5 years or so since we went public and raised the money, and we have executed on all these things that we said we're going to execute on. I see that as just a major accomplishment. And then when I see companies like Reddit spent $400 million in the last 12 months, it's like my heart explodes in pride because of what we've done, it's pretty remarkable what we've done compared to the other competition out there.\\nNow let me know if I'm making it a little bit too simplistic, but it sounds like you've done something more in a faster time with less resources. Is that a fair summary of the situation?\\nThat's exactly right.\\nThat's wild. That blows my mind. I don't really know how earnings calls are run in the back end. But it sounds like there was one part when you were speaking about it that I don't know if you just don't have enough time, but I wanted to give you the forum to speak a little bit more, it seems like you were starting to bring up Reddit and almost how -- at a certain point, maybe the start of Reddit, you kind of appreciated it. It almost sounds like a lot of what I hear in this building, the messaging of why you want Rumble to succeed to protect free speech for everyone who cares about it. It sounds like that resonated with you for a little bit at the beginning of Reddit story.\\nYes. I think, Tom, the analyst that was asking me the question was talking about the values of it. I think this is very missed in the public right now. But Reddit was founded on the principles of free speech and freedom of expression. Aaron Swartz, he's passed away now, but he was one of the founders of Reddit with Alexis, and Steve, I believe. And Aaron Swartz was a free speech absolutist. He was one of the main activists that were against censorship. And it's just like fast forward, like from the time they founded Reddit almost 2 decades ago to now, and Rumble's being censored on Reddit like -- and I deplore that, like I deplore platforms that sensor and do that, like you can't even post Rumble links on Reddit within DMs, according to some news articles that I read a couple of years ago. So...\\nI got to put it, Rumble's being censored on...\\nAccording to news articles that I read out there, that is...\\nWhat a world we live in right now.\\nThat's just it is that this company was founded on this very similar principles that Rumble was founded on, but they've clearly changed their path, and they made a lot of adjustments. And there was a lot of uproar within the community of Reddit in the last couple of years of what they did, but they clearly don't share the same values that we have right now, especially if they're censoring Rumble lengths. That's just -- that's horrible. But one of their founders is not -- unfortunately not here today, was one of the biggest proponents and strongest defenders of freedom of expression, and he was against censorship.\\nWow, that has blown my mind. I guess in that exact same vein of thought when I was doing the best I could to prepare for this exact conversation, I saw some interesting messages from you this morning on the Internet talking about the app store and who's using what social media. Is this in the same vein as thought? Is this the day that you're like, I guess, publicly saying to everyone that hang on who's on the side of free speech and who's not?\\nWell, every company is different and they have their own prerogatives. Obviously, Rumble or ethos is against censorship at all points. Threads is -- I think they're openly against -- openly for censorships. So not something I participate on or use. But every company is different. There's a lot of companies that have different focus. Our focus is obviously allowing dialogue, allowing authentic expression, allowing people to speak their minds. What kind of world we will be living if we can't do that. That's not one that I want to participate in. So that's obviously something that's core to our ethos and something that we push. I can't say what companies like Reddit should do or I have my opinions on what they should do, but they're running their businesses the way they want and they're entitled to do what they want to do. That's their freedom of expression to basically choose what they want to do as a company. But the ethos of Reddit, a few decades ago, was definitely the same ethos that we had.\\nIt's kind of sad at a certain point of like where I am in my life and so many people trying to figure out their way in this world. Sometimes you almost take it for granted. You just assume that as a base fact of how life is going to, you can say what you want. And then you don't realize almost the man behind the current that unfortunately has to be people fighting for it, like the fact that, that's even a requirement in this day and age that someone is standing up to protect it. Teams of people are setting up to protect it, the fact that is required. It's kind of a sad state.\\nIt is required like -- it seems to be a trend. And I think this is the one trend that Rumble doesn't fall into. And that is like you start at a point of allowing people to express themselves and you start on the proper mission and then certain forces over time start pushing you into different directions, like, for example, 2 years ago, we were asked by France to remove some creators. We were asked by IBM, who are releasing our bare metal from to remove some creators. And not based on policy violations, not based on anybody's TOS terms, just based on the fact they didn't like them, IBM made that decision. \\nAnd like over July 4 weekend, our engineers pulled off, like the biggest thing they could ever done with Rumble is that we moved a lot earlier than we wanted to, a lot of Rumble onto the Rumble Cloud that you see today is that -- and that was simply a forced hand by IBM at the time, and which is crazy because we already made the decision, like a year prior to this happening that we were going to invest in cloud. So we luckily had all the equipment and everything ready to go, and we were able to do it. But by no means did we want to do that over that weekend at that moment in time, but we're essentially kind of forced to do it and forced to do it really fast, not based on any TOS, just based on someone not liking a specific creator. \\nAnd that's like it's disgusting. It's like one, you're going to like try to hurt a company to do that, and it doesn't even violate your TOS, like if you're going to do that, give notice, change your TOS, give it 60, 90 days to set in and then do it. Don't e-mail us on a Friday night and say, \\\"Hey, you have 48 hours to correct this or otherwise we shut you down. That's what they did to [ Parlor ]. They tried to do it to us. And with us, it didn't work. And it will never work. We made ourselves uncancelable now, and that's what's like really, really amazing about Rumble. We're not going to follow these trends. We're not going to get pushed around by anyone. We're going to stick to our TOS. We're going to stick to what we believe in, in our mission, and we're going to go forward, whereas like every other platform from Reddit to you name it, every platform starts from a physician where they say they're going to allow all this expression, and they get to a point where they're getting pushed around by whoever it may be.\\nI know you're from Canada, but in the U.S., a core tenet of the country is freedom of speech. And it seems like exactly that so many people would love to talk the talk, but then when it comes time to walk the walk, sometimes, I guess, there's other pressures that eventually make them for whatever reason, A, B or C, switch it up. So I guess to more so tie this together, from a technical perspective of where we are in this world right now, obviously, you've been able to execute that via Rumble Cloud, and it's just a way to not only protect yourself, but other companies and just, I guess, infrastructure required people, companies, whatever it is, that they're also protected. And it seems like one of them that's been working recently very well is true social. And obviously, DJT now trading, a lot of excitement there. I know it was touched on a little bit in the earnings call, but is there more you want to add to that?\\nWe're like -- me personally, I think what Devin Nunes has done with DJT True Social Trump Media and Technology Group, whatever you want to call it, has been unbelievable. It was in a state where everyone was saying like it couldn't get over -- couldn't get across the finish line. It was in that state for quite some time. And Devin has been working day and night from what I see, and he got it across the finish line. He took the company public as the CEO. And now they have an entity worth a lot of money and a lot of cash in the bank. Obviously, they're an incredibly important partner to us on the cloud and now in the publishing advertising side. So we couldn't be more happy for that to happen. But what Devin has done is it has been nothing short of amazing. He's done an amazing job and getting that over the finish line. When everyone said it couldn't happen, like everyone told me it's not going to happen. He did it. So he deserves like a massive amount of credit for what he's done there. So I'm excited about that. \\nThey get to -- they're now in a position like everyone is like, oh, like what are they going to do? Like they haven't been given the chance to do much like they have been like isolated by all kinds of different things. Now they've reached a point of freedom where they can do all kinds of things. Think about their valuation they have. Think about the amount of money they have in the bank. Think about the potential that can provide a platform. They already have true social, which has like a really loyal user base on it. And now they have all the resources to go and grow that and do magical things like -- I think just based on what you see what Devin was able to accomplish by getting it over the finish line, imagine what he's going to be able to do with having all this cash in the bank and having the valuation that he has. I definitely wouldn't underestimate them. They've pulled off amazing things. So we're excited that we're just their partners. That's an incredible thing -- incredible spot to be in. So I'm really excited for it to see what they do.\\nAnd now obviously, just we're going through the hot news of all the social media. So we might as well keep the momentum going. What's the deal with you're willing to be a part of the consortium where you're the technical provider for potential divestiture of TikTok here in the U.S. I saw Kevin O'Leary talking about it. What's going on there? Because, obviously, the TikTok the potential been is hot news.\\nYes. I get this question a lot. The TikTok thing is really interesting because you got to step back and ask yourself if we get into a situation where ByteDance has to divest TikTok and someone else has to own it in America, you got to ask yourself who can own it? Number one, Google? No. They're going to have antitrust issues. They have -- there's -- I don't think they're even remotely in play for TikTok or they can't be, in my opinion. Meta? No. So you take away the 2 biggest companies in the social media space or in the Internet space, which are Meta and Google, and then you ask, all right, well, who has experience with any sort of video and any sort of technology and any sort of algorithms. If Meta and Google are off the map, who can do that? When you look at all the companies out there, there might be cloud providers interested, Rumble is a cloud provider. There might be video companies interested, Rumble is a video company. I don't know who can step in and fill that role better than Rumble. I do believe we are the best candidate to be part of that consortium on the tech side. I can't think of a better partner. \\nNot only are we taking video and we have cloud and operating both of those things at the same time, but we're also working on probably one of the most important features that TikTok has, and that's their algorithm like -- and I don't think ByteDance can -- is going to be giving the algorithm in any of the purchases with TikTok and obviously, in recommendation engines and algorithms at Rumble are something that we're really, really working on since we've obviously gone public and have all this investment now, having a recommendation engine on Rumble, which we're going to be releasing slowly here in the next week -- in the next few weeks, and it's going to continue to improve. But our first iteration will start hitting hopefully this week, maybe next week. We're the only company that's touching these things and even investing in these things that I know of that I can think of in -- when you pull out Meta and you pull out Google, which are going to have antitrust concerns. \\nSo absolutely, I think Rumble is the best candidate to be part of that consortium, and I want to be part of that consortium. And Kevin said it very well, I've spoken to Kevin, and he said it very well, like Rumble is high-res video, TikTok is low-res video. We do have low-res video as well, too. But who better to fit that role? Kevin's right, Rumble is a good partner in any consortium on the tech side. I can't think of a better one.\\nIt sounds like you do have very similar ideas. There's no sense in letting the U.S. version of TikTok die. It just sounds like maybe there's some national security issues to get it under the right umbrella here somewhere in the U.S. and let it go because obviously, it's wildly popular.\\nYes. And that's more of a decision for the Senate and the House, obviously, the House voted for it. I'm not going to get involved in whether I think it's a good idea or a bad idea. There's a lot of different opinions on that. But in the event that the Senate does vote, and we already know that Biden is going to -- he expressed that he would endorse that. If that does happen, we want to be a part of it. If it doesn't happen, then obviously, that's -- we're not going to be a part of any consortium if the Senate doesn't vote for it. So we'll see what happens. I think it's in the hands of the Senate. And if it does go in the way of divesting, then we want to be part of those discussions.\\nThat is awesome. And maybe one of these days, we'll have that huge announcement. Before we turn it over to the audience who has probably many, many questions for you, I want to give you an opportunity, what are this year, which many times you've referred to as your Super Bowl year, what are some of the major things like you personally as a human fighting for free speech are excited about?\\nSo 4 core products, Video Platform, you have Studio, you have the Rumble Advertising Center, and you have the Rumble Cloud. All 4 products right now, I'm equally excited about because they've -- they're kind of all like in their -- getting in their good stage and good state right now at the same time. So we haven't really had the time to really kind of see. But the one that has had a little extra time for us, we've -- is the Rumble Advertising Center and man, I'm excited about it. And I've said this on the earnings call is that March is looking really nice when it comes to the Rumble Advertising Center. It's giving us confidence in the ability to be able to say that we'll see sequential revenue growth starting in Q2. \\nSo I'm really excited about RAC. And the reason why I'm excited about RAC, I think that's an important thing is that RAC is going to compete directly against Google AdSense. So when I say it's going to compete against them, it's going to compete with them on the publisher side. So AdSense takes on publishers, we're bringing on publishers, publishers already using RAC right now. They started getting onboarded this month and last month. Drudge Report is one of them that's testing it. [indiscernible] testing it, the Gateway Pundits running it. There's like many publishers now using RAC and testing RAC and the results are very promising for us right now. And that gets me so excited. \\nNot to mention, we haven't even introduced mid-rolls, we haven't really introduced minerals in OTT or Minerals in app like there's so much opportunity for inventory to create more inventory into RAC that I see such an open field of what RAC can do and where -- from where it is today and how far it can go. I can't even see how far it goes because it looks like it's like -- it just seems like there's so much inventory out there for us to grab. \\nAnd then on the flip side, you have the advertisers that are coming in, and that's growing. Our advertiser base on there is growing really nicely here in the first quarter. And that excites me because like I see all the stars aligning for RAC to really kind of kick into high gear as we go quarter to quarter to quarter. And it seems like a fairly easy path. A lot of publishers really like it. I think the Gateway Pundit said that it's doing better than other advertising partners, and they said that publicly. So that is so exciting. \\nBut like it's hard to say what's the most exciting because I -- we got cloud that we just built a launched last week, a week ago, 2 weeks ago, how is that not exciting. And then you got a Studio that's going to be launching here shortly with the live read ads that creators can do, both small and large creaters. And then you got the video platform, and it's an election year. So it's like there's so many things that are happening right now. It's hard to pick one, but if there was one that we have the most visibility on, it's RAC right now. I would say RAC is giving us -- is a little bit more on the mature side of the products and the visibility that we do see is exciting.\\nI can honestly say to everyone watching right now, these aren't just the words of the CEO. This might come as a surprise, but I'm a content creator on Rumble, and I, on the content creator side, have actually seen RAC a couple of months ago, I got an e-mail a beta like, \\\"Hey, do you want to join the beta program. And every week, every 2 weeks, personally seeing the progress of not only the efficiency of how it's pitched to me, but the amount of different advertisers coming in, it's not moving at a linear rate. It's truly exponential. So as much as the CEO is saying it's working, I can tell you as an individual content creator on the platform, I'm seeing it firsthand and the growth of it, like I said, it's not just linear, it's exponential. So I wouldn't be surprised as you're kind of alluding to in the next couple of quarters for that momentum to build up in like real dollar size value. So that's going to be exciting. So I definitely understand your excitement there. \\nWith that being said, should we turn it over to the audience here and see what's on their mind?\\nYes, I think taking questions from the audience is always one of the best things.\\nPerfect. Perfect. All right. Let's -- folks, this is the time for you to speak with the man that met the legend, Mr. Chris Pavlovski himself. Let's see what this first one is, much potential here and a great deal accomplished in the past year. Now it's delivery time, ring that cash register Rumble revenues game time. That's from [ egg ] man co. All right. Here's a direct question. What has been the market response to Rumble Cloud?\\nSo we just launched the Rumble Cloud. And obviously, we launched Rumble Cloud with a huge partner. That's Truth Social. That's -- I think they're like #6 in the social networking space. I posted that which is like interesting, and I want to -- maybe we should talk about that a little bit because it really kind of -- it really shows like how big they are and how important they are. But to answer the question, we launched it a couple of weeks ago. They're one of our largest cloud customers. We also had RFK junior joined. We brought in partnerships with KinSHIFT and ACP CreativIT, and obviously, it's too early to provide any guidance or to give any kind of insight on what it's looking at. \\nBut like just based on the general and just that we're seeing like I said, it's something that we're super excited about. And I think that Cloud is a much different beast than the Rumble Advertising Center, bringing on clients and the sales cycles of clients are completely different. For some -- for new guys, it's pretty simple. For larger guys, it's a little bit of a heart surgery to pull off AWS or wherever they are, it takes time. But with that said, the early indications are very promising for us and we're really excited with the partnerships that we have already put together here in the last 2 weeks. \\nSo both ACP and KinSHIFT are going to be great -- are going to be really good arms for us to help on that side.\\nI think you inherently answered the second question as well, is this report from last year, so Cloud won't be taken into account until next financial report.\\nWhere is this report?\\nSo I think it is Q4...\\nSo yes, the earnings that we just reported is for Q4 2023. We launched the Rumble Cloud here in the final weeks of Q1 of 2023 -- I mean, 2024. So you're not going to see Cloud for a couple of quarters out at this point right now.\\nAnd then obviously, then the time, a little bit of a lag there. Where is Rumble Kids category? And should we have a Rumble e-mail?\\nVery interesting question. And the reason why we haven't got into the e-mail space is that if there's other companies out there that are doing it well, no need to get into it. I'm not going to -- I can't -- we can't compete in every spot and there's already companies that are doing it like Proton Mail and others. So there's good solutions out there. Rumble Kids is something that we've thought about, we're still thinking about and how we deploy that, we want to be very careful. Something we're -- eventually, I think we'll get there. But our focus right now is on the core products that we have and the core content that we have, Rumble Kids, probably, I would say, within 2025, I would say, maybe 2024, but that would be something more for 2025, I would say.\\nOkay. I appreciate that. Is Rumble's competition more of YouTube or Reddit?\\nWell, Rumble competes directly against YouTube and the online video platform space. When it comes to Reddit, the way we compete with companies like Reddit are more in the advertising market, so -- for advertisers, bringing in ad dollars. So you compete with a lot of companies for advertising dollars. So in terms of like Rumble as a video platform and that particular component of our business, YouTube is our #1 competition. YouTube is a monopoly in that space, and they basically run that online video sharing platform space at this point.\\nTo expand on that question a little bit more, then do you also view Microsoft, Google and AWS to be competitors on the Rumble Cloud side of things?\\nYes. So when you get to the cloud market, the competitors there, I would call that more of an oligopoly with Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure and on AWS, the biggest one. And then to a lesser extent, you have Oracle and you have Digital Ocean and a few others. But it's those 3 big guys that contain most -- the largest market share in the cloud business. So they pretty much dictate the cloud world in a large way.\\nSo I spend more of my life and I'd like to admit reading financial reports. And when I look at something like YouTube, I know the rough numbers they could do in a year, but then I look at these cloud numbers, in your mind, do you think that Rumble Cloud could actually end up dwarfing Rumble the content side? Are your visions that big for cloud?\\nIt's a really good question. I think cloud is so independent to the Rumble Advertising side. You have just -- what is YouTube doing, like $30 billion, $40 billion just on the advertising side of the video. So that's a big amount of revenue. And then how much is AWS doing on Cloud? Like there are $80 billion or something...\\nSo if you did AWS...\\nIt's like -- and I think YouTube for Cloud, YouTube is probably bigger than Google Cloud at this point. I still think, but I'd have to double check. So they're both massive markets. And I don't know which one would be bigger than the other. It really depends and it will take some time to figure that out. But I'm unsure at this point.\\nI guess it's almost a good problem to have when the potential is so big...\\nYes, just this massive markets independently there. Amazon has obviously got the biggest chunk of the market. The cloud market is overall bigger than the online video sharing platform market. But it's definitely -- it's a much more crowded market as well when it comes to cloud.\\nSo with this, since we're just on the subject of cloud, obviously, a lot of this is enabled by the hardware from the likes of NVIDIA and semiconductors in a general sense. With that, obviously, right now, we're in the phenomena of AI. Like right now, I hear AI bubble every single second of my life seemingly. Is Rumble getting into the world of AI? Do you have thoughts on AI? Anything there? Like obviously, it has to be on your radar? What's your initial knee-jerk reaction?\\nSo this has changed a lot over, I would say, the last 3 months to 6 months, I've been really looking into it deeply, especially as we're launching the cloud, and we're starting to see that there's like a demand for a lot of these H100s NVIDIA chips. So we're -- this is an ongoing conversation internally right now at Rumble is how much do we invest in AI and in these chips and trying to build a solution on the cloud side that could help that. And I kind of touched on it a little bit in our earnings release. We're going to iterate based on the way the market demands and whatever the market demands from us. At this point, we're definitely on the cloud side, really considering and evaluating AI tools on the hardware side and seeing how we could be of help there to certain customers. But nothing is in stone quite yet, but it's something that is very, very much a big topic of conversation internally and how we invest further into Rumble's Cloud infrastructure. \\nAI on the Rumble side is a little different, but we're working obviously on some algorithms and some recommendation engines that we think of that could be of great help for content creators. So there is a lot more focus on this here in this current quarter than there has been in the past, both on the Rumble video platform side and on the Rumble Cloud side. \\nA little bit more further along in terms of obviously we have to build recommendation engines and really good ones on the Rumble platform side, but still remains to be seen on the Rumble Cloud side, how we're going to invest and what we're going to invest into as we expand.\\nIndividually, I'm happy to hear that you guys are receptive to it, and I appreciate you going down that rabbit hole with me. I'm a Mod running the Rumble sub-Reddit, all Rumble links, videos and websites are automatically blocked and we have to manually prove them every time. So this is what you were alluding to, some issues with -- okay, Black Box. I didn't know that. I appreciate you sharing that with me and the entire audience. But -- so they have to manually prove improve every single one, that's crazy. That's ludicrous.\\nYes. That is like absolutely horrible. Rumble was the platform. Think about this for a second. Rumble was the platform for the Republican presidential primary debates and you weren't allowed to share the official links on Reddit for the Republican primary presidential debates. What do you call that?\\nIt has to be some sort of meddling with the leader of the free world...\\nIs that not -- like is that not like election of interference, like that actually really upsets me. Like the whole Reddit thing really, really upsets me. How could they be blocking links to Rumble. Like how does that happen? Where in Reddit's ethos when they started, were they even for this type of stuff. They were never for censorship and now they're censoring, that means they were censoring the Republican debate. That's what that means. If that's true, if they're blocking our links on that platform, then they have a lot to answer to, because that's absolutely disgusting in my view that they would be blocking Rumble links.\\nI mean you probably can't say this, but from my vantage point, when you kind of brand yourself as the underbelly of the Internet and kind of anything goes, it almost seems hypocritical then to be blocking all these links like it doesn't make sense. So you can't parade yourself as being the cool part of the Internet and then all of a sudden, like when -- for whatever reason, if it doesn't suit you, you go the opposite like that doesn't make sense.\\nSomething happened at Reddit. I don't know what happened. They lost their mission, I guess, when they sold it to Cond\\u00e9 Nast, some ownership there. Clearly, when that happened, took it in a direction that I absolutely disagree with. And Frankly, I think it's -- they've done a disservice to the American people by blocking links to other sites and in particular, Rumbles. I just shake my head and disgust. It's just wrong. And I'm glad I'm talking about it because like I've been -- I've known this for a while, just -- but it needs to -- people need to know that this is just absolutely wrong.\\nJust 2 different sides of the fence. So you've been sitting on it, well, the rest of this right now are feeling blindsided by a piece of information that just was not well known. I very much hope between now and the next earnings when we can sit down that you have new updated, hopefully, positive answers of what's going on. And hopefully, a new redirection that I suppose the public would find a little bit more palatable. \\nLet's go to this next one. Does Rumble have plans to bring more comedy specials to Rumble and possibly add a comedy category to the main page?\\nSo I think we do have a comedy category. We just need more comedy. So if you have comedy and you want a live stream, I think everyone that has like a comedy special should be -- or doing a comedy skit, they should do it live, put it on Rumble, throw it in the Rumble category of comedy like and get more viewers that way. I think that would be great. I'm all for it. Comedy is a great category. \\nLike Rumble kind of started in the funny video space, comedy space. So it kind of brings us full circle back to kind of the way we started. So I'm all for comedy all the time.\\nPerfect. What's to stop Rumble from becoming part of the censorship regimes once you leave or when the company becomes bigger? Part 2, if rumble purchases TikTok, will you let it operate without any censorship?\\nSo the first part, one of the most beautiful things about Rumble is that there are so many -- like what do I -- how do I say this? The employee base, the staff at Rumble from the top to the bottom is 100% for this mission. This company is built on this mission from every staff member. This wasn't an acquired company that had a different philosophy. This company was built on the foundations and the ethos that we have. Whether I'm here or not, I am certain that everybody in this company would -- it's just you'd be -- there's no way anyone can survive in this company that's pro censorship, that's just not going to work in this company. \\nSo I have no doubt that whether I'm here or not, like if I'm here, definitely not, and if I'm not here, most definitely not. I don't see a concern with that. And as we get bigger, I think we're getting stronger. As we're getting bigger, we're telling Brazil to go pound sand, we're telling U.K. to go pound sand, we're telling France to go pound sand. We're the ones that -- we're not capitulating. As we get bigger, we get stronger, and we're pushing back harder and the system is moving more into the direction that we like to see it. We're fighting in all corners of the world for what is the first amendment, it's freedom of expression. It's also a basic human right that people have. And we're fighting in every corner of the world for it, and we will continue to do that with me or without me that this company is built on that ethos and it's not going anywhere here. \\nIf Rumble purchases TikTok, will you let and operate without any censorship? \\nWell, here's the thing with the consortium. We don't know who the partners would be. We don't -- first of all, we don't even know if it's going to happen. We don't know who would be operating it. We don't know what part we would be on the technology side. So -- there's a lot of different -- there's going to be a lot of different players, a lot of different interests. And obviously, we all know how I feel about censorship and I would -- I am totally against it. I deplore it. I don't use threads because they do openly advocate for censorship. So definitely, it's something that -- it's hard to answer at this point in time because we just don't know the makeup of what it's going to be and how it's going to be, who's going to be there or what our role could be. If we're just a cloud provider on the tech side, there's not much say we could have there. So it really depends on the aspects and how Rumble could be part of that consortium and what role we could play. \\nLike I said before, obviously, we'd love to help on the cloud side. We love to help on the operational side. We think we're the best candidate for it. I think we can do a lot and lead a lot on that category, but that's more up to a lot of different players and interest if the Senate even passes it. So there's a lot of ifs and there's a lot of different factors here to consider.\\nGot you. So a little bit of time is going to tell. I'm all for no censorship though. That's what I would advocate for at all points. \\nThis next one why aren't paid partners like Kai and Barstool promoting Rumble more off-platform. Is there a push to bring more people to locals like Candace Owens Justed and to integrate locals into the Rumble app. So maybe it seems 2 distinct questions. Part one. Why aren't paid partners like Kai and Barstool promoting Rumble more off platform?\\nSo Kai and IShowSpeed were promoting Rumble yesterday and early this morning on their Instagrams, they're posting Rumble links to their streams. In Barstool, Dave Portnoy was live on Rumble this morning using only the Rumble chat and talking to the Rumble chat and telling people to go to Rumble to watch them. So I think they are. Is there a push to bring more people to Locals like Candace Owens just did and any [indiscernible]. So the Locals app is somewhat integrated right now. Is there -- we're definitely looking at doing a better and a more comprehensive integration with locals that's in progress right now, and we should see some developments by the end of the year. And with -- we're always continuously trying to bring more people to Locals like Candace Owens and Candace Owens just opened up a Locals account. I believe this week, was it this week, I'm losing my days here. I think Monday. I can't remember it was last week or this week, but yes, she's there.\\nI must test personally to Locals for any content creator or potential content creator watching this, one of the coolest things, and it always blows my mind because you cannot get this anywhere else. When you have your own private premium community, no other place in the world do they give you the e-mail list. I've said this before, and I'll say it again, but the fact that locals are like, yes, download it. You can do whatever you want with it. To this day, it blows my mind. So a [indiscernible] for those of you who don't know, he is the creator of Locals. I mean, hats off to you. It's an idea that any of the direct competitors I think they would like puke a little bit in their mouth that they were forced to do that. And then you guys are like, yes, have it.\\nYes, they don't want to give that away because if you give that a way that allows the creator to have more independence and do whatever they want, but our way of thinking is like, let's just give it away and let's try to be the best platform and made the best platform win. And I think that makes us a better platform in many different ways. And I think that's the right call. And that's something that I -- that's a real good competitive advantage to others.\\nSpeaking of best platforms being the best one. Chris, would you change anything about TikTok?\\nIf I were to operate it, obviously, the censorship there is a concern, but there's a bunch of things that you could change and you can make better. But at the same time, you don't want to do too many things that would cause it to be worse, right? Clearly, they're doing -- they have a recipe that's working and it's working well. I think they could definitely walk away from the censorship. I don't think that's going to hurt them in any way. But outside of that, I don't really see anything specific that it would change. Don't fix something that's not broken, right?\\nThat's fair. Can we get a premium to remove the ads, the ads company off during live stream?\\nYes. You can go into your profile -- on desktop computers, it's a lot easier to do it. You can't do it from your mobile app yet. So you can go to your desktop computer, and you can subscribe to the Rumble starter package, which will remove all ads on Rumble. So there is a way to do that. And you get a little lightning bolt in the chat to say that you're a premium -- Rumble premium member. But we're actually introducing this package into the apps very shortly. So you should see it there within hopefully in a month or 2.\\nBut you could get it right now in real time on the desktop.\\nYes, you could do it right now on the desktop, no problem. You go to your dashboard and you click on pro packages and you just take the cheapest package there, and it'll give you -- It will take away the ads on the platform.\\nOkay. That's great. While we have everyone on the Internet gathered here in one spot, do you have any final thoughts that you want to share with how things wrapped up in 2023 or what you're looking forward to in big plans for 2024?\\nI just reiterate, I think we had a remarkable year. We executed on all the products that we said we're going to execute on. We did everything that we said we're going to do. The team here has never been more excited, including myself, for what we have. We have a real business today. And now we can go sell that business to the market. And that's the fun part because up until now, it was like we needed to build something similar to DoubleClick. We needed to build something comparable to YouTube and get it up to standard, and get it better. And we've come so far, and now we're finally here. It all kind of came together here. We got the cloud in the last couple of weeks of March, like it's -- we got it ready before the end of the first quarter of 2024, and now it's showtime for us. This is where we got to show the world what we can do, got to show the world that what we have and what we've built is ready for prime time and I think it is. I know it is. It's already showing lots of signs of life right now, and I've never been more pumped about it. \\nSo we have a really, really beautiful business right now, and I've never been so proud of the whole team on executing on this in the last year in such a short period of time compared to our competition and what they do. I always go -- I'm always going to go back to this now. They spent -- Reddit spent $430 million in the last 12 months. That's more than we raised when we went public, and we have built far more, in my opinion, than they have, both like on the hardware side, from servers to cloud all the way up to a video platform and live streaming. \\nWe're not using Amazon, AWS for any of our live streaming products. We're not using them for our Cloud. We built our own Cloud. So I don't know what they're spending $430 million on, that's their prerogative, but that's not how we spend our money here. I think we've done a remarkable job with our cash to build what we need to do. We've now built it. Now it's time to go make money. I've never been more excited.\\nMan. I mean this goes without saying, but a huge congrats to you and the team. And obviously, thank you for you guys carrying so much weight on your backs. And then on a personal note for me and the audience, the fact that you're taking time out of your day to chat with all of us and go more in depth to your thoughts and your plans and your ideas for execution, it means a lot to me. I know it means a lot to them. And hopefully, we can do this again and even better quarter in a couple of months ahead. So thank you once again.\\nThank you, Matt. Thanks for coming out to Rumble headquarters. Let's do it again.\",\n          \"Good morning, and welcome to the THG Plc Q4 Trading Update Call. Today's call will be hosted by Matthew Moulding, Chief Executive Officer; and the THG executive team, who will be happy to answer your questions. \\nAnd now, we'll start from the question-and-answer session.\\n[Operator Instructions] And we will now take our first question from John Stevenson from Peel? Hunt.\\nI've got 3 questions on the Nutrition to get us going, please, if we can. Firstly, on the whey price, how quickly will the manufacturing capacity start to bring it down? And until it does, I guess, to what extent you intend to mitigate the impact and to what extent do you intend to sort of ride it out and take the margin hit to gain share next year? \\nSecond question, can you talk about the performance of your sell-throughs in the retail partners and give an update on how the sort of licensing product is performing as well. And then finally, can you just talk about some of the strategic targets for the year ahead, please?\\nSure. So what I'll do, John, there, I'll answer it from the back mode to you. I'll be answering all questions and otherwise, I'll point out who's going to speak apart from myself. But I'll answer the first one. We might come back to the other 2. So when does the new class to come online? I mean look, as we've pointed out on whey pricing that we've been in this market now for 13 years, and it's been a relatively stable market. Like every commodity, you'll get ups and downs and whatever. But we've only ever seen 2 highly volatile periods like this in the 13 years following 2022, following COVID and the war, and then one in the last 12 months. \\nSo even without new supply coming online, we would expect the market to normalize in any event. But obviously, the big investment plans, because it's quite an extensive process to create very high quality protein, and there's 9% additional market supply expected to come online this year. The first of those factories -- from different manufacturers and different producers. The first of those come online in March. The 9% all comes in America, in the American market. And as you go into next year, there's an additional facility coming online in Poland as well for the European market, albeit will be a slightly smaller amount. \\nSo we're expecting the global capacity of high-quality protein to grow by at least 10% over the next sort of 12 months or so. But there'll be a steady onboarding of new suppliers and we'll -- obviously, we source our routing globally, but it is a global commodity. So wherever it comes online in the world, it will have an impact on supply and demand in the rest. So we are expecting that to feed through. \\nAnd in terms of, in our numbers, what we're expecting is, is we've assumed a relatively high level of protein -- whey protein pricing in half 1 and slightly better than the prior year. And then we're expecting half 2 to be about 25% lower. And then what would happen from there is if the whey pricing itself has doubled, so more than doubled really over the past 12 months or 13, 14 months, and so a 25% reduction is one thing. If you would then take another 10% of that, every 10% is worth somewhere in the region of about GBP 10 million of profitability.  \\nDepending on where the prices are, you would either -- a large proportion of that at these levels would come back to the business. Obviously, at some level, you would put that back into the proposition and drive that forward. But given the handle of pricing today, if -- as and when that comes down, a good proportion of that is going to come back into the Myprotein business. \\nAnd it's worth reflecting on that, though, if you were to look at 2023, I think the profitability in Nutrition was somewhere close to about GBP 90 million of EBITDA, and that was in a normalized market. So I think we may have put an estimate in the RNS that said somewhere along the whey price impact for this year alone is about GBP 40 million, that was the Japanese yen. So as that starts to normalize, without that profitability come back, it wouldn't always be a straight line depending on the competitive landscape and things. We put some back into consumer as well. But we've done -- we've put a lot into the consumer over the past 12 months in any event. So payback will be due at some point.\\n I think the second question was about offline retail, was it, in terms of the sell-through. I mean, look, it's going very well as you can imagine, because that was a nonexistent native market to us within India 2 years ago. If you were to walk into a lot of the U.K. [indiscernible] presence and that brand presence is expanding at a greater amount. It's not just the U.K. in which we want to do that. Obviously, we want to do that in all territories of the world, and we've got a very strong plan in rolling that out, including in Asia or India in the U.S. and [indiscernible]. \\nSo they're separate strong, but that's really supported by the brand awareness as well. Protein, if you get the information, if you put it together from Google and also from U.K., gulf of U.K., whichever way it is, the position of Myprotein in the year has gone -- has gotten very strong. So if -- I think we've had our increase in brand search is 19% year-on-year. The market itself grew by 6%. So the position of the Myprotein brand through the year has got stronger and longer, and that's why the offline demand for our brand is very strong. And when it goes into offline retail as well, it goes incredibly well. \\nSo despite some of the challenges that we faced in the Nutrition division that we've had to navigate this year, the fact that the brand demand continues to be so robust has been really encouraging. I think the third point, if I remember it right, was on the strategic. So look, last year was a very busy year for strategic initiatives. We discontinued some businesses. We disposed of some noncore businesses. And then we did a major demerger to the year of the Ingenuity business. \\nAnd we're all too aware of the [indiscernible] right now in terms of the LSE and valuations, et cetera. And we're aware, obviously, the market cap doesn't make a lot of sense to a lot of people. I mean probably the best thing I could say against that would be Ingenuity is now a private company, backed by an awful lot of small investors. And if you were to look at that business, it's somewhere in the region, in dollars, of about an $800 million revenue business this year, delivering $50 million to $55 million of EBITDA. And as of this morning, it sat on $130 million of net cash. And yet, that business valued on the market at less than the value of cash. \\nSo if I was to come to stock market today with that business with thousands of staff and robots all over the world, then I would imagine a lot of people will be begging us to list it on the stock market. But we're not going to do that at a negative value or -- and obviously, we tried that and it has relisted. So we're aware of the challenges for all the stakeholders of the current position. The focus will be to continue to try the business forward and trade well. But at the same time, we'll always be looking at strategic initiatives. And I would hope that as the market improves this year or we will deliver on more strategic initiative this year.\\nWe will now move to our next question from Wayne Brown from Panmure Liberum.\\nAlso 3 from me. I'll probably take them one at a time, if you don't mind. On Nutrition, you've clearly got a good story to tell on offline, seeing a lot more distribution. In Q4, your average order values were [ 10% ]. So if the rebranding, which took place last year, saw your pricing down 10% to [ 50% ], does that mean your volumes are greater than 20% down in Q4? And how do you go from that run rate to mid-single digit in 2025? That's my first question, please.\\nI'll answer the 2025 point. I'd have to go back and check the later on specific volumes. But as you talk about that, just on the average unit value has been seriously depressed through last year at a time when whey protein by [indiscernible] was exploding because we've had to shift through the old stock and even old packaging and things like that. So that's been quite an extensive and very complex exercise in which to do. \\nSo what we then come into for this year is we will be confident in depressed average value for last year. So clearly, we would expect those values to increase and increase materially through the year as we sort of deliver on the rebrand that's now behind us and we don't have that stock to clear through. So we're expecting tailwinds in that angle in particular, at the average selling price. And then the other tailwind that we would be expecting for the Nutrition division this year is, is just the sheer affordability of whey protein. \\nSo if anyone goes and tries to shop online for whey protein today, it's still somewhere in the region of 70%, 80%, probably more expensive than it was on 14, 15 months ago, to buy that branded product. Now as you make it more affordable, naturally, the volumes will then increase because it becomes within reach of a much wider global market. \\nThere is a third tailwind that we are expecting for Nutrition as we progress truing the year, which is around FX. FX was one of the big challenges for that division last year. It's got -- it's a big business in Asia and particularly in Japan, and the Japanese yen suffered its devaluation. We've had moments towards the end of the where it looks as thought it [indiscernible] quite ended. But what we have seen now is actually is pretty much in line. \\nAnd so as we look through this year and then we can see what happened last year, there has been a softening of the yen since the second half. And as a result of that, we would expect that, that then becomes quite a strong proposition for us back in Asia. Because it's not just the property that gets hit as you're trying to sell products into Japan when the FX has gone against you, it's actually the competitive nature of the product. So whey goes up and your pricing relative to peers goes up because the FX is seriously gone against on that. So we are expecting that to be a tailwind for this year. \\nAll of those factors combined mean that we are naturally expected it to be a much more progressive year for Nutrition and a steady return back to a normalized business model or with the assist of a first-class global branded Nutrition proposition that we have. In terms of just answering the prior year stuff, I think we probably need to come back to you on that. Just got that and what we disclose and what we don't disclose, but that's the view on 2025.\\nSure. No, I suppose in the guidance of mid-single digit for Nutrition in '25, are you still assuming that it's the volumes then? I understand the tailwinds you've just mentioned, those were very clear. But on a volume perspective, are you still budgeting for negative volumes?\\nIt's probably budgeting -- no, we don't disclose that, but it will be somewhere near flat, I'm guessing. And the other factor is on volume taking into account. When things get expensive, people will buy a lot of the smaller, cheaper things. So the net-net volume won't necessarily be down. It's just people will be buying different products. \\nSo for example, when whey pricing is cheap or normal, people will buy a much bigger bag of that product. But when they're struggling on the pricing, they will buy a smaller bag. So what it doesn't mean is, is that people are buying less of Myprotein products, what it can mean is the size of that product is what's been affected. Now naturally, that then means that there's less whey protein being sold when pricing is very high. They're buying from our brand, but they're buying at a smaller level, which would help explain why search demand is up 19% year-on-year, versus the market only 6%.\\nVery helpful. Similar question on Beauty. In Q4, your average order values were plus 8%. And having a chat earlier with -- your ex manufacturing, the underlying performance was probably plus 3.5%. So volumes were also down in Beauty. Can you just explain that? And then how we see that playing out as we move into '25, please?\\nSure. So 3.3%, I believe it was excluded manufacturing, because you will get a volatility in manufacturing. And I think it's well documented that there's a lot of beauty brands out there seeing some volatility in their sales at the moment. Now we obviously are with them in doing that. And whilst we might have purchase orders and have produced product, we're not going to ever force that on because -- to any brands because it's not good for the business, and it's not good for them and it ends up that in you anyway. \\nSo we will always support brands were sensible in that and that's why I had the manufacturing business occasionally, it can be a little bit from -- and impact the numbers. But it was 3.3% growth in Q4 for Beauty, excluding the manufacturing. That compares to 2.5% in Q3. So we have seen an acceleration in Beauty in that period. Now again, what we'll do is we would need to really break it down to the products that are being involved in that. Because people naturally will move their spending patterns around -- this time last year, there might have been more devices, there LED masks where we have been a massive popular thing that could have taken a greater share last year. \\nWhereas this year, it could be more fragrance or it could be cheaper products that go into there. So mix could well be a part of that. But to be very clear, the Beauty business is in route heaven and delivered an acceleration on the retail side from 2.5% to 3.3% in Q4, driven by the face shields of Lookfantastic and Cult Beauty, both doing well. Cult Beauty doing especially well. \\nAnd then the one final point to add to this as well is just to remind people that in 2022 and 2023, we put the Beauty division through a massive overhaul. And as part of that, we pulled back from chasing customer orders that were the least profitable furthest away from where our global distribution centers are. What that naturally does is it does impact on various stats and numbers. So the U.K. performance would have been outstanding. There's no doubt in that because we fulfill everywhere in the U.K. \\nU.S., likewise, we do had a really good performance in the U.S. Parts of Europe, which are furthest away from our all-in distribution center, where historically may not have been -- it might have taken 2, 3, 4 purchases to get profitability from a customer, we would have pulled back from that and raised our price and reduced our marketing, which will have hurt some of the volumes in that territory, and it is worth taking that into account as well. So it's a complex answer. That not need to say, oh, yes, the volumes might be down because the AOV go.\\nNo, no, absolutely. That's very helpful. And leads me on to my last question, if you don't mind. I totally get the point about moving to higher-quality customers, and that's also part of your shift from bottom of the funnel marketing to top of the funnel, which is brand marketing, and that's clearly played a part in the strategy over the last 12 months. \\nI'm just trying to get a feel for how that overall marketing spend is going to change in 2025 and how we should think about that impacting the top line. As you clearly shift to more high-quality company, customers absolutely get that, but that could potentially come at more of a cost of top line growth, and how we should think about that and then the margin impact, please?\\nYes, sure. Look, on top line growth, I mean, we'll -- we've obviously had a great year in Beauty, probably close to a record year when you consider the 2020 peak probably year that you've had through Colane COVID. So the progress that we've managed to do through Beauty, navigating the sort of return to the high street and the rest of it, we're super pleased with. \\nThat momentum as we come into this year. Look, we naturally have to adapt to the world. But we are spending our marketing dollars slightly different, and we continue to plan to do so. We've even opened up the first Lookfantastic stores. That we'll open a second one in due course, which will be announced shortly. And we know we'll probably have 4, 5 or 6 or somewhere across the U.K. within due course to ensure we've got the absolute best brand supply available for online at the same time. \\nAnd then how we're spending our marketing dollars between some of the social channels and some of the other areas, we're managing it very carefully and measuring it at the same time to ensure that where we spend the money we feel we get in the return. So I don't believe at all is going to be impacting profitability of the business. So we're not going to be saying we're going to spend GBP 10 million in above the line and we'll see a payback in 3 years from it. When we spend above the line in these slightly different ways, we're doing it because the data that we're monitoring is showing that as a return to it. It might just take a few months rather than a few years for us to see the benefit. \\nAnd so there's a lot of measurement going on internally at the moment that says, well, instead of just spending a lot of money with Google or with Facebook or whatever doing things slightly differently and what that might yield, and just a big project ongoing with that, if we see that change in anywhere, we change back. But it doesn't mean we're going to be spending any dramatic or less with the existing people per se, we're just doing a lot of different things. \\nI don't think any of this is particularly an impact on the trajectory of where the Beauty business' top line growth will be or bottom line growth. We'll continue to be running it to the best of what we can deliver.\\n[Operator Instructions] And our next question is from Andrew Wade from Jefferies.\\nThree questions from me. First one on the Nutrition side of things. You talked to the offline story now. But you also mentioned you say about a much improved run rate at the start of the new year. Any color you could give us on that would be very helpful. That's the first one. The second one, on Beauty, that sounds like a pretty strong margin performance through there. So could you tell us a bit about what the exit rate is? And also, is that putting any upward pressure on your sort of longer-term aspirations for the Beauty? \\nAnd then the last one on potential interest costs. Obviously, the group is going to look pretty different from a cash consumptive versus cash generative perspective. You don't need to hold as much cash on the balance sheet. Just wondering what views on where financing costs -- that is bank financing costs, not the IFRS 16 element, where bank financing costs could come down to?\\nSure. So run rate, how we're looking as we start the year for Nutrition and offline products. I mean, look, we're expecting really good solid progress in offline this year. These things take time to deliver. So you don't just decide you're going to go into offline and then suddenly, you get those sales within 6 weeks. So a lot of work has been ongoing now over the past a couple of years to get to this point, but the listings are growing. And so we'd expect that to really be a positive for us through this year. \\nIn terms of the online sales, yes, we have seen an improvement in that. It's worth just reminding everyone, when you bring an end to having to sell old stock on the Myprotein website, then that's a win-win because you depress the whole sort of image and look and value proposition by having to discount that stock and sell it through, which we opted to do that as opposed to putting it through discount channels. Because if we did drop the stock out through discount channels,, then we would have really hurt our prospects for the offline market because that would very much offset the retailers, and they wouldn't want to dispose until a significant period of time in past that job gets started to have gone into the market. \\nSo generally speaking, much better run rate, we'd be expecting the division to be returning to growth in the very near future. And that's not just excluding Asia, that's as the full division. So -- and January has seen that momentum show good fruit, let's say. So yes, we're feeling good about that. \\nThe second question you had on Beauty margins and whether that's got all that pressure on that. Look, we set a medium-term target for the Beauty margin, and we've hit that. So we hit that early. I mean, look, we've got to be careful about setting big expectations on Beauty for now on that. I think having delivered that is a really good, solid position. Let's just keep driving that forward and make sure we keep that top line progression at the same time. There's no point having a super profitable division that's struggle for growth or in decline, making more money by doing that because that's a zero-sum game. \\nSo I think we're in a really solid position. We'll continue to build on that. And the margins that we've delivered is perfectly acceptable for the medium term and would deliver everything that we needed to deliver if we do that. The focus really for us is maintain that and then let's get the Nutrition margin back to the normal position, and then we really have got fantastic group progress. And so that's where the primary focus will be. \\nThe third point on interest stuff. I mean, look, just to reiterate, as you say, Ingenuity has gone out, all of that CapEx has come out. Much, much reduced CapEx is -- we've got GBP 400 million of cash on the balance sheet, another GBP 150 million of RCF, which we've never used since IPO. So you're right, there's a lot of growth sort of leverage in there. We'll look to reduce that through this year. And then as part of that, naturally, we should be able to reduce our interest costs over time as well as part of that. Reduce the gross leverage [indiscernible] cash generation of the business. \\nThe lease costs have come down dramatically because half of those lease costs are more -- have got into Ingenuity. And a lot, lot more of the lease debt gone into Ingenuity as well. So I think we're well positioned for that. But the primary focus now is just getting Nutrition recovering back to its normalized levels, and that will naturally then impact cash as well at the same time because it's real cash when you do that. Have I answered them, Andrew.\\nYes, that's great.\\nNo problem.\\nWe have a follow-up question from Wayne Brown from Panmure Liberum.\\nGents, just on that exit rate in offline, clearly a good story coming through there. How are you seeing or thinking about if people are just picking up the marginal purchase in a shop now as opposed to see, how should we be thinking about that kind of if there's a cannibalization story? Or is it something you think you're just targeting a new customer in the main?\\nSure. Look, we spent a lot of time looking at this. And there's entry point into the market was completely new products, so for bars and snacks and things like that. Then we went to licensing the brand into other areas. So you'll see the big mall deal that we came up with [indiscernible] international. So all of these things are touch points where we make good money out of them, and there's really strong brand awareness. \\nActually, then as you go into a store for some of the other products -- it's a really tight range in every store. So if you compare the website, the website will have thousands of product lines. But in the stores, there will be just be a very limited range because stores can only hold so much products. So we don't see cannibalization in that regard at all. And there'll be some sort of very minor cannibalization, which naturally happens with everything. But nothing at all would we would worry about.  \\nThe idea that someone walks into a Sainsbury's or any grocer across the world and picks up a single unit of Myprotein bar or something else is a real win for us and so we see it as a positive. But we will keep an eye on the cannibalization as we roll it out and make sure that it's worth it if there is any of that ever is sold.\\nWith this, I would like to hand the call over to Matthew Moulding, Chief Executive Officer, and THG executive team for closing remarks. Thank you.\\nWell, thank you very much, everybody, and thanks for the support through last year. And most importantly, thanks to everybody at THG and Ingenuity. It was a very, very busy finish to the year and much appreciated for the sacrifices people made. So thank you. We look forward to speaking to you in April, probably next. Thank you.\\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect.\",\n          \"Good morning. Welcome to the Lantheus Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. This is your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded for replay purposes. A replay of the webcast will be available in the Investors section of the company's website approximately 2 hours after the completion of the call and will be archived for at least 30 days.\\nI will now turn the call over to your host for today, Mark Kinarney, Vice President of the Investor Relations. Mark?\\nGood morning and welcome to today's call. With me are Mary Anne Heino, our CEO; Paul Blanchfield, our President and Bob Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer.\\nMary Anne will begin the call with introductory remarks and then turn the call over to Paul to provide a strategic and operational update. Bob will cover our financial results and provide updated guidance. Mary Anne will provide closing remarks, and then we will open the call for Q&A.\\nThis morning, we issued a press release, which was furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission under Form 8-K reporting our third quarter 2023 results. The release and today's slide presentation are in the Investors section of our website at lantheus.com.\\nI would like to remind you that any comments made during our call today could include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note that we assume no obligation to update our commentary or any forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties. Discussions during this call will also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is also included on the Investors section of our website.\\nIt is my pleasure to now turn the call over to our CEO, Mary Anne.\\nThank you Mark. And good morning to everyone. It was another terrific quarter for Lantheus with reported revenue of $319.9 million, up 33.7% year-over-year and progressed our internal R&D and our business development efforts to expand our pipeline.\\nI'm proud to report we have impacted the lives of more than 4.7 million patients year-to-date. We believe our market leading position in PSMA imaging and our advancing pipeline, combined with our unique capabilities, will continue to support our position as the leading radiopharmaceutical focused company.\\nPYLARIFY is the clear market leader in PSMA PET imaging. Growth during the quarter was driven by brand preference for PYLARIFY, due to its clinical and commercial value proposition. We believe PYLARIFY offers the best combination with our proprietary PSMA targeted ligand and the F 18 isotope.\\nTurning to the total market opportunity. We estimate the current addressable market for the PSMA PET imaging agents to be $1.6 billion and believe this market potential will grow to more than $3 billion by 2028. As such, we remain encouraged by the current and future growth potential of PYLARIFY.\\nPNT2002, our investigational PSMA target radiotherapeutic asset represents another significant opportunity for growth within our prostate cancer franchise. PNT2002 is designed to treat patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer or mCRPC who have progressed following treatment with an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor or ARPI.\\nWe are excited about the progress we have made with our partner POINT Biopharma and look forward to the top line data from the Phase III SPLASH trial in fourth quarter 2023.\\nAs we consider the radiopharmaceutical landscape, we view the proposed acquisition of POINT by Eli Lilly, as further validation of the opportunity we see for PNT2002 and PNT2003 and the increasing role of radiopharmaceuticals in life sciences.\\nIn addition to prostate cancer, we have a number of exciting assets including PNT2003, our late-stage radiotherapeutic product candidate for neuroendocrine tumors. Another asset is MK-6240, our investigational Tau imaging agent intended to assist the diagnosis and staging of Alzheimer's disease patients, which was recently granted Fast Track designation by the FDA.\\nAnd finally, our fibroblast activation protein or FAP, targeted PET diagnostic imaging agent is being clinically investigated in multiple tumor types. To supplement our ongoing R&D efforts, we will continue to leverage our significant radiopharmaceuticals expertise and resources to target business development opportunities.\\nWith that I'll now turn the call over to Paul.\\nThank you, Mary Anne, and good morning everyone. During the third quarter, PYLARIFY delivered sales of $215.4 million, representing almost 50% year-over-year growth. \\nWe attribute this strong performance to the prostate cancer community's recognition of PYLARIFY's clinical and commercial value. Year-over-year growth was driven by existing accounts, new accounts and additional PMF activation.\\nSequentially, growth was again driven by our existing accounts, offset by seasonal trends consistent with those reported across the healthcare sector, as well as greater holiday impact and one less selling day. This resulted in relatively consistent weekly dose demand in June, July and August, followed by more robust growth in September, which carried over to October.\\nWe expect PYLARIFY, which has been used in more than 250,000 scans since launch, to maintain its position as the #1 ordered PSMA PET imaging agent because of 3 main clinical attributes.\\nFirst, PYLARIFY delivers reliable diagnostic performance with accurate detection rates without a high false positive rate. Second, robust pivotal clinical data shows change in intended management in patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer. Third, PYLARIFY demonstrated consistently high reader agreement and reliability in our pivotal trials.\\nWe also believe the adoption and utilization of PYLARIFY are further supported by our commercial value proposition, including PYLARIFY as the #1 ordered PSMA PET imaging agent in the U.S. and is a proven diagnostic backed by real world experience, including in over 250,000 scans across 47 states.\\nWidespread availability, with PYLARIFY being the only PSMA PET imaging agent that is available through a diverse, multi-partner F 18 network, which ensures convenient and reliable supply. Broad market access with more than 90% of covered lives having access to PSMA PET with PYLARIFY. For these reasons, we believe PYLARIFY will continue to be the clear market leader in PSMA PET imaging.\\nWe are encouraged by the recent developments in the reimbursement landscape. In July, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, put forth several proposals for comment regarding possible changes, including separate payment for diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals.\\nLantheus, along with numerous industry organizations, submitted comments and we expect CMS to publish final 2024 regulations shortly.\\nSimultaneously, we continue to collaborate with industry and advocacy organizations to pass the FIND Act to ensure all prostate cancer patients continue to have access to innovative radiopharmaceuticals, including PYLARIFY. Regardless of the outcome of the CMS regulations, and status of the FIND Act, we are confident in PYLARIFY's future growth prospects.\\nWe see a significant growth opportunity for PSMA PET imaging. While we believe the current addressable market remains about 350,000 scans or $1.6 billion, we have updated our estimates for the total addressable market to be approximately 600,000 scans or more than $3 billion by 2028.\\nTo realize this potential, we anticipate radioligand therapeutics will move into earlier lines of therapy, including both pre-chemo, mCRPC and hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, which would increase the need for PSMA PET imaging for both patient selection and monitoring.\\nAdditionally, we expect to see increased adoption of PSMA PET imaging in the intermediate favorable patient population as physicians realize its clinical benefits and additional data is generated.\\nFinally, we expect the incidence and prevalence of prostate cancer to grow approximately 2% to 3% per year. Due to these factors, we believe there is significant opportunity for PYLARIFY to grow in both the near and long term.\\nSwitching to our microbubble business. DEFINITY maintained its strong momentum with third quarter sales of $67.3 million, up almost 11% year-over-year. We expect increasing procedure volumes and our promotional efforts to enable sustainable growth.\\nWe continue to work closely with our partner, POINT Biopharma, to progress PNT2002 clinical and regulatory manufacturing and commercial readiness work streams, including establishing an expanded access program, otherwise known as a compassionate use program. We look forward to top line SPLASH study data in the fourth quarter of 2023.\\nWe have also seen positive developments for MK-6240, our clinical stage PET Tau imaging agent intended to assist the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.\\nDuring the third quarter, we signed agreements with 4 prominent pharmaceutical companies to provide MK-6240 as a biomarker. With these additional agreements, MK-6240 is now being used in more than 90 active clinical trials.\\nWe believe that Tau imaging has the potential to play an important role in patient staging, selection and monitoring for future treatments and could be a surrogate endpoint for treatment efficacy.\\nI will now turn the call over to Bob.\\nThank you, Paul, and good morning. I will provide highlights of the third quarter financials, focusing on adjusted results unless otherwise noted.\\nRevenue for the third quarter was $319.9 million, an increase of $80.7 million or 33.7% over the prior year period. Earnings per share for the third quarter were $1.47, an increase of $0.48 or 48% over the prior year.\\nTurning now to the details, beginning with radiopharmaceutical oncology. The category contributed revenue of $216.3 million, up 49.5% year-over-year with PYLARIFY at $215.4 million with consistent sequential quarterly growth when adjusting for seasonal and holiday impacts and 1 fewer billing day in the quarter, as was noted by Paul.\\nPrecision diagnostics recorded revenue of $96.3 million, up 8.2% from the prior year quarter. Sales of DEFINITY were $67.3 million, 10.9% higher as compared to the prior year quarter. TechneLite revenue was $23.3 million, up 5.3% from the prior year, due mainly to opportunistic sales.\\nLastly, strategic partnerships and other revenue was $7.3 million, driven primarily by a milestone and dose revenue from MK-6240 within pharma solutions. As a reminder, we sold our rights to the RELISTOR licensed intangible asset associated with net sales royalties midyear and don't expect to be recording any further revenue with the exception of any potential future milestone payments.\\nGross profit margin for the third quarter was 67.2%, an increase of 100 basis points over the third quarter of 2022 on a similar basis. As has been in the case in recent quarters, the increase is due mainly to favorable volume and product mix led by PYLARIFY and DEFINITY, partially offset by the margin headwind of 93 basis points attributable to the RELISTOR royalty asset sale.\\nOperating expenses were 10 basis points unfavorable from the prior year at 23.5% of net revenue and $19.2 million higher on an absolute dollar basis, which is in line with previously guided expense levels.\\nCommercial investment continues to focus on driving PYLARIFY branding, awareness and adoption, alongside ramping efforts to prepare for the launch of PNT2002, inclusive of a market research and overall commercialization readiness.\\nG&A expense increases year-over-year relate to our ERP implementation, which remains on track as well as investments in cyber, compliance, enterprise risk management analysis and employee engagement.\\nAdjusted operating profit for the quarter was $139.5 million, an increase of 36.5% over the same period prior year. Total adjustments in the quarter totaled $24.6 million before taxes. Of this amount, $14 million and $11.7 million of expense are associated with noncash stock and incentive plans and acquired intangible amortization, respectively.\\nAlso in the quarter, we recorded a gain of $51.8 million on the sale of the RELISTOR royalty asset within other income and expense. The remainder is related to acquisition and other nonrecurring expenses.\\nOur effective tax rate was 23.8% in the quarter. The resulting reported net income for the third quarter was $132.0 million and net income of $103.1 million on an adjusted basis, an increase of 45.9% over the prior year quarter. GAAP fully diluted earnings per share were $1.88 and earnings of $1.47 on an adjusted basis, an increase of 48% over the prior year quarter.\\nNow turning to cash flow. Third quarter operating cash flow was $116.7 million as compared to $93.6 million in Q3 2022. Capital expenditures totaled $14.6 million, in line with expectations. Free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $102.1 million, an increase of $14.6 million over the prior year period.\\nDuring the quarter, the company received net proceeds from the RELISTOR royalty asset sale in the amount of $97.8 million, which has been recorded in net cash flows from investing activities.\\nCash and cash equivalents net of restricted cash now stands at $614.1 million. We continue to have access to our $350 million undrawn bank revolver and are very comfortable with our strong liquidity position.\\nTurning now to our updated guidance for the full year. We are tightening our full year revenue estimate to be in the range of $1.255 billion to $1.27 billion from the prior range of $1.245 billion to $1.27 billion. In doing so, we are lifting the lower end of our prior PYLARIFY revenue range to $840 million to $860 million from $835 million to $860 million.\\nAs was the case last quarter, we expect DEFINITY to continue its momentum and also expect MK-6240 to contribute $15 million to $20 million of revenue rather than the prior guidance of $15 million.\\nTurning now to earnings. Adjusted EPS will be in a range of $5.80 to $5.85 versus the prior range of $5.60 to $5.70.\\nWith that, let me turn the call back over to Mary Anne.\\nThank you, Bob. Our third quarter results were driven by the commercial growth of our market-leading products. We believe our differentiated capabilities, commitment to innovation and excellence and our significant capital resources position Lantheus to remain the leading radiopharmaceutical focused company as we work to find, fight and follow disease to deliver better patient outcomes.\\nWith that, Bob, Paul and I are now ready to take your questions. Operator, please go ahead.\\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question, it comes from the line of Roanna Ruiz from Leerink.\\nSo among the assumptions going into your new future total addressable market assumption of over $3 billion, I was curious what are the largest drivers in terms of how many scans would be added to build up to the 600,000 scans, I think you mentioned on the call. And just how are you considering new PSMA PET competition in there along with your strategies for PYLARIFY growth going forward?\\nSure. Happy to take it, Roanna. Thank you for the question. So, yes, we raised -- we had a current addressable market, as you noted, of about $350,000, and that's the estimate of this year, which equates to about $1.6 billion. We've heard your and investors' feedback you think about what the future potential could be. And so we've highlighted today the total addressable market, which we would estimate by 2028 to be about 600,000 scans.\\nOn the investor presentation this morning, you'll see the largest driver of growth there is the expansion of radioligand therapy into earlier lines of treatment effectively from the post-chemo setting or third line into second line and first line otherwise known as pre-chemo, as well as the metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer group. And, therefore, that would increase from potential 30,000 scans for patient selection and monitoring to approximately 210,000 scans.\\nIt's a relatively consistent number of scans per patient, but more patients would be eligible for radioligand therapy. And so that's naturally the largest driver of the expectation by 2028 based on our belief of radioligand therapeutic approvals in the coming years, including potentially PNT2002.\\nThe second biggest driver would be in the recurrent setting, and this is really driven by overall incidence and prevalence as men continue to live longer, as well as a slight uptick in the number of scans per patient over their lifetime assumptions.\\nAnd then finally, the initial staging for suspected metastases, which is some incidence increases over time, which we expect to be about 2% to 3% per year. But there, there's also an assumption that we see greater penetration into the intermediate favorable population\\nAnd so that's really where we're looking out to 2028 to say this has the potential to have a $3 billion market in that time frame, which overall makes us incredibly excited about the future of PSMA PET imaging and PYLARIFY in particular. And we believe with our continued commercial and clinical value proposition that we highlighted today and that we continue to promote in the marketplace, that we can and we'll be the market leader for many years to come.\\nRoanna in many of the comments that Paul just shared are outlined on Slide 9 of the deck that we used with this call and which will be also on our website if you want to refer back for more of those data points.\\nYour next question, it comes from the line of Richard Newitter from Truist Securities.\\nCongrats on a solid quarter, and thanks for the increased detail on the addressable TAM. So, I guess, you highlighted a lot of expanders there to go from $1.6 billion to $3 billion over time, but not all of these, obviously, are going to be accessible, Paul, as you just pointed out overnight.\\nSo I guess just the question I had is, as we look at '24, is there enough runway with the $1.6 billion TAM and the initial TAM expanders at the front end of that '23 to '28 time frame to grow PYLARIFY next year. I think the consensus is, looking for high single-digit growth, about $940 million. I'm just looking to see -- is that a reasonable starting point? And can we expect growth next year in PYLARIFY?\\nFirst of all, I appreciate the question. Today, we're naturally talking about the third quarter, and in due course, we will be talking about 2024. I think we're incredibly pleased with PYLARIFY's growth launch to date. We grew year-over-year, as I mentioned, almost 50% of what we're able to do. The current addressable market is about $1.6 billion. But overall, we still see continued growth potential in both the near and the long term for us to be able to see continued growth.\\nAnd, indeed, we do expect to see continued growth of PYLARIFY next year and for multiple years to come, but we haven't put an exact number on that. We will naturally provide guidance as we do every year when we report our fourth quarter earnings in February of next year.\\nAnd the one point I would add, Rich, and you heard in answering Roanna's question you heard Paul say. We still have a very conservative estimate as to number of scans per patient. A lot of what we'd outlined for growth is really just based on new patient populations coming into the pool for consideration. But certainly as physicians continue to appreciate the clinical utility of using PSMA PET imaging, especially with PYLARIFY, we would expect also to see the number of scans per patient grow.\\nAnd for your next question, it comes from the line of Matt Taylor from Jefferies.\\nSo this could be for any of you, I guess. But I did want to touch on point. You mentioned the Lilly deal as validation. And I saw in the presentation you were talking about doing some investments in market research and launch readiness. So I guess, maybe you could just illustrate for us what you're doing to get ready for it? And any reads that you have from seeing the Pluvicto data a couple of weeks ago and what that could mean for POINT and your opportunity there?\\nRich, I'm going to start, and then I'm going to turn it over to Paul. Because what I'd like to, I'll say, declare right now is that we will follow the same model for PNT2002 that we did with PYLARIFY. And that is the testament to how ready we were for that market, how we entered that market, how we reacted or related with all the stakeholders in the market.\\nWe really see that as having been very successful in creating a wonderful market model that can be replicated with PNT2002. And in some ways, it will be easier, because we're at this point now we're already familiar with largely the entire audience, certainly with the channel. And so we will leverage all those relationships as we prepare for that launch.\\nBefore I turn it over to Paul, he can make some more comments on our commercial readiness. I will speak to the PSMAfore data in saying that we're glad to see data on these types of products being reported. Now certainly, there will be more data analysis by Novartis, and we are eagerly awaiting our own readout of the SPLASH data, which will be fourth quarter 2023. But we think both these modalities show great promise to the Street --\\n-- plasma system. And then I'll have a couple of follow-ups.\\nWe believe there's strong therapeutic promise for these products. We'll wait to see the exact data and to also, of course, analyze our own SPLASH data in fourth quarter 2023. And with that, I'll turn it over to Paul to finish our comments about our commercial readiness for PNT2002.\\nThanks, Mary Anne, and thanks for the question, Matt. So as highlighted today, we continue to work with POINT across clinical and regulatory, across manufacturing as well as commercial readiness. And so we are working closely, indeed daily with our colleagues from POINT to ensure that we are ready for a best-in-class launch of PNT2002. That will naturally include a number of traditional work. It's understanding the market, it's patient mapping. It is effectively market research to understand this.\\nI would also note that, while we're focused on the commercial side of things, bringing a radiopharmaceutical to market is also reliant on a fully integrated supply chain. And so understanding and working with our customers to be able to get them ready to be able to treat with potentially another Lutetium product is also in the mix.\\nAnd so we've got a number of activities there that have kicked off in 2023, and we would expect to continue into 2024 and beyond.\\nAnd for your next question, it comes from the line of Anthony Petrone from Mizuho Group.\\nCongratulations on the quarter. Maybe just one on PNT20O2, the opportunity there you sized PYLARIFY, but just wondering if you could provide an outlook on PMT2002 versus the expectations and the market sizing that Novartis has out there?\\nSo again, I'm going to turn it over to Paul to offer commentary. But I would point you to Slide #9 in the deck that we just released, because that does speak to as one of the categories those patients who are being candidates for radioligand therapy.\\nThanks for the question, Anthony. So as we've highlighted recently, and both Bob and I actually discussed this at an investor conference in September, we had previously said that the market potential for PNT2002 in the U.S. is approximately $3.5 billion. That was a number that we put out effectively last year when we announced the POINT collaboration.\\nWhat we've since said is, while we have not formally updated that number, we have highlighted that we think the potential overall for radioligand therapy and mCRPC patients could be substantially bigger. What we've seen with Pluvicto year-to-date, public would say they would be approximately doing $1 billion in sales in their first full year on the market, even with supply challenges where they were not able to add new patients.\\nIndeed, in their, I believe, their recent earnings call, they noted that they are now actively adding new patients. And so for a product in the post-chemo setting to do potentially $1 billion in its first full year on the market without full supply, demonstrates that we think there is significant opportunity in this, not to mention it's only an effectively third line or post-chemo.\\nAnd so when we expand PSMA therapeutics to pre as well as post chemo, we think this is a substantial opportunity that ourselves and our partners POINT are incredibly excited about, and we look forward to sharing top line data for the SPLASH trial in the fourth quarter of 2023.\\nAnd one quick follow-up would be just synergies. If we assume PYLARIFY and PNT2002 is under the same umbrella, just maybe a little bit on how go-to-market would play out. It looks to us that PNT2002, if approved, would be basically synergistic to the existing PYLARIFY sales force? And would you contemplate maybe bundling those 2 solutions?\\nThanks for the question, Anthony. I think there's naturally benefits of having a franchise that includes a PSMA therapeutic as well as a PSMA diagnostic recognizing that in order to be eligible for a PSMA therapeutic, you do need to be scanned with a PSMA diagnostic.\\nAnd so I think we do have -- certainly, I would call this, synergies or advantages because of that robust market position. And indeed, we believe that was one of the reasons why it was a natural fit for POINT and Lantheus to work together last fall when we announced our collaboration agreement.\\nAnd so there are certainly advantages to having both, if you will, under one franchise to be able to have conversations with customers. That said, we also recognize that there are distinct needs of a therapeutic versus a diagnostic. And therefore, we're going to continue to invest to be able to support a therapeutic and ensure that we maximize the potential for PNT2002 as well as PYLARIFY recognizing they're awesome comparable call points, specifically for urology as well as potentially medical oncology. But we're going to ensure that we invest adequately to support the launch of PNT2002 and the significant market potential that it brings.\\nYour next question comes from the line of Andy Hsieh from William Blair.\\nCongratulations on continued execution. I want to ask about data coming out of ESMO and the regulatory dynamics. It seems like Novartis has to wait until 2024 to make a submission decision due to the apparent detriment on overall survival with a hazard ratio of 1.16. And when you look at the internal pipeline, does that open the door for PNT2002 to potentially leapfrog Novartis as the first filer in the pre-chemo setting?\\nSo it's impossible at this point to estimate what the regulatory filing time lines will be for both products. As we've noted, I think, very repeatedly, we are eagerly awaiting the SPLASH data readout in fourth quarter 2023, and that will really form all of our strategy.\\nWhat I will say is I think that there is a willing and open attitude of the FDA to bring these modalities to market. And I think that is something that both we and Novartis are also focused on making these treatments available and accessible to patients.\\nAnd we're very confident, and as I said, again, we're looking forward to seeing the SPLASH data. Once we have it, we'll be able to compare it more fully to the PSMAfore data and to have that inform our regulatory strategy and what we would see as the regulatory time line for both these products.\\nYour next question, it comes from the line of Justin Walsh from JonesTrading.\\nIt might be a little early to get a solid answer on this, but I'm wondering if you can help contextualize how you view the size of the potential mid- to long-term market for an asset like MK-6240.\\nThat is really a great question and one that is top of mind for us. We look at what's happening in Alzheimer's disease and the progress of the therapeutic candidates there. And then also the scientific communities, I would say, analysis and consideration of amyloid versus Tau imaging and what it infers about patients and where they are in their staging and where they are in their kind of their clinical time line.\\nAnd for many reasons of what are really emerging data, we see great potential for Tau imaging agents in their role in helping to not only diagnose but more importantly, stage Alzheimer's patients.\\nAnd while I'm not willing to give a dollar figure around that market now, I will say that we are very, very impressed with what the size of that market can be. And again, we are not the only company with the Tau imaging agent under development or approved. But we think that MK-6240 offers some advantages in performance that will be important to the market.\\nJust as a note, on an annual basis, there were 6.5 million patients who are diagnosed, and it is wonderfully still a very highly prevalent population as well. So it's a very large market, and we are really thrilled about having the opportunity to serve it.\\nYour next question, it comes from the line of Lawrence Solow from CJS Securities.\\nJust a couple of follow-ups. Most of my questions have been answered. But on PYLARIFY, Paul, you mentioned year-over-year growth coming from new and existing accounts sequentially. Obviously, it's a little slower growth, too, but just in terms of you said mostly out of existing accounts. Can you just give us an update on sort of where you stand and your reach to -- there's still a lot of potentially new accounts that you haven't reached yet. Can you kind of give us some thoughts around that? And also, you mentioned PMF facility expansion. Can you give us just an update on the sort of scorecard there?\\nThanks, Larry. Appreciate the question. So we made a distinction, year-over-year, if we compare the third quarter of '23 to the third quarter of '22, growth was driven by existing accounts as well as new accounts and additional PMF activations. If we speak sequentially, the vast majority of growth was driven by existing accounts. In that were over 50 PMFs, whereabout 54 PMFs currently activated.\\nWe do continue to activate new PMFs, specifically in geographic areas where additional dose time flexibility is important. But the driver has been and continues to be, if we look kind of quarter-over-quarter and certainly into the future, will be the activation of existing accounts where we already have imaging centers, whether they be freestanding or hospital or government facilities that have access to and are regularly offering PYLARIFY and where it is certainly being requested by name.\\nThe real work that we've been on for the last year is to continue to activate the referring community. That would be urology, that would be medical oncology, radiation oncology, for them to understand who the target patient is, the frequency in which those patients could be scanned and we still see significant room for growth in that space.\\nThe vast majority of accounts have adopted some sort of PSMA PET imaging, a market that's annualizing approximately $1.3 billion, meaning there's not too many accounts out there that are not already adopting. There may be some small mobile type facilities where either due to geographics or just timing of offering we have to be able to add. But I would call that effectively de minimis going forward.\\nReally, the growth in this market is going to continue to be the activation of referring physicians, ensuring that they understand the breadth of our label and the significant potential that PSMA PET imaging can make to clinical practice as evidenced by the change in intended management data, where this is not just a diagnostic, this can truly inform patient management. And we think that clinical benefit plus our broader commercial benefits will continue to support our growth going forward.\\nYour next question, it comes from the line of Yuan Zhi from B. Riley.\\nCongrats on the quarter. Can you please clarify the total cost of a PSMA PET scan on average? I mean the cost of the agents and the procedure in either hospital setting or outpatient setting.\\nYuan, first of all, thank you for the question. I may ask a follow-up question to you, if you will. But the total cost of the procedure is certainly going to vary. So if you think about the cost of procedure to either a hospital or a freestanding imaging center, there's naturally a cost of the tracer, which would effectively be PYLARIFY for the vast majority of PSMA PET scans, and then there are certainly 3 other commercial agents and 2 other academic agents available. \\nCommercially, the agents are priced relatively close together. And so when we look at what that is, that's a fairly consistent cost across the marketplace.\\nNow to estimate the cost of the procedure, there's a fixed cost that's going to be associated with the PET/CT scanner, which is usually an investment in the millions of dollars, but then will last many years. And then there's naturally the staff associated and otherwise. I can't estimate what that is. That is different for each imaging center and hospital.\\nBut overall, PET/CT has been adopted in this marketplace for decades. It continues to grow. And I think we've seen the benefits of PYLARIFY cause a number of institutions to even think about increasing number of PET/CT scanners that they have to be able to better support the patients they serve and the referring physicians that come to them. I don't know if that helps answer the question.\\nI would just add, one, that the whole market that was built by FDG is really what built the PET scanning market, especially in oncology, in the United States market. So it's well built out, and I think it's well -- the financial aspects of it are well understood, but they are also then different by each product. Because, as Paul noted, while the medical art associated with offering a PET scan may be similar across different products, it would be the cost of the tracer that would be different.\\nYour next question, it comes from the line of David Turkaly from JMP Securities.\\nMaybe just a real quick one for Bob. Thanks for pointing out some of the impacts in the quarter. But if we looked at the seasonal trends, the holiday and then the 1 less selling day. Is there any way you could put like an approximate dollar amount on what you think that cost you in the quarter?\\nThe way I'll answer that, David, is maybe by sort of normalizing or adjusting to the sequential growth rate. So if you make the adjustments, and we do see this, and we pointed out coming out of the last quarter that, we would see increasing sort of impacts from holidays, particularly going to July 4 in this case and Labor Day. And then we will see it again when we get to Thanksgiving and then the week between Christmas and New Year's.\\nBut if we look at the impact of the things that we highlighted, we would have expected that the adjusted growth rate sequentially to be something in the mid-single digits which is why we kind of use the language around a consistent quarterly sequential growth rate. Because if you look at the growth rate from Q1 to Q2 and now Q2 to Q3, and then the implied guidance, if you will, in Q4, they're all very similar kinds of growth rates.\\nDavid, maybe I'll just add. I think when we look at the dynamics of the quarter, and as I highlighted on the prepared remarks, June, July and August had relatively consistent volumes on a weekly basis, taking out the holiday weeks, if you will. But where we saw growth continue at more historical levels was the August to September and the September to October. And we believe that's consistent with what we see across the industry.\\nIndeed, DEFINITY, which we've been at for 22-plus years, our third quarter is always our weakest quarter and is even down sequentially. And where you look at other procedural-based reporting organizations, July and August are relatively slow.\\nNow in the past couple of years, we may not have been able to see that and our financials, may not have depicted that as much because the growth trajectory of PYLARIFY at 100%-plus growth, activating new PMS, adding new accounts, that doesn't necessarily stick out. But if you look at last year as an example, our sequential growth Q2 to Q3 was also the lowest sequential growth of the year. And so that's consistent with what Bob just highlighted.\\nAnd we have a follow-up question from Roanna Ruiz from Leerink.\\nJust a quick one for me. I'm not sure if I heard it on the call. But have you mentioned the current market share for PYLARIFY in the quarter relative to last quarter? I think last quarter it was around 70% penetrated.\\nThanks, Roanna. We had not mentioned it. We have not gotten the question. Overall, I think PYLARIFY remains the clear market leader and number one PSMA PET imaging agent with over 250,000 scans since launch.\\nWe believe our share was relatively consistent in the quarter at approximately 70%. I do use the term approximate, recognize that only 2 of the 4 commercial players actually report PSMA PET revenues. But overall, we now added competition in the quarter, we believe that impact was relatively minimal. And so we are comfortable that our continued commercial and clinical value proposition as well as the significant growth potential as highlighted by the $3 billion plus potential by 2028 will continue to ensure that PYLARIFY continues to grow and also remains the clear market leader for many years to come.\\nWe have a follow-up question from Rich.\\nThanks for those seasonality comments on PYLARIFY, it's helpful. I'm just curious, Bob, I think you had mentioned that you still have some selling day issues or holidays between 3Q and 4Q. But your updated PYLARIFY guidance actually assumes that you show a 6% or close to it at the midpoint quarter-over-quarter growth rate.\\nBut I'm just curious, is that just 4Q pickup, which more than offsets maybe the holiday impact, which it didn't have because of a weak July-August or weaker -- softer July-August and 3Q? What drives the reacceleration there?\\nAnd Paul, you can jump in on this as well. But one, we've been really pleased with the recent trends that we've seen from a dose volume perspective, which I think is fairly consistent when you look across broader health care. Once you get into that post summer seasonality that you do see a pickup once again as patients return to the docs and the docs return also to back to work after a summer.\\nSo that range does not include -- we're not adjusting, if you will, for those holidays. And you can see, I think we provided a visibility to what those holiday periods look like. Again, what we've seen more recently is informing our guidance range. And of course, from a selling day perspective, Q4 and Q3 are similar. So that it would only be the holiday impact.\\nI don't have a lot more to add. I think we've seen robust growth. We saw it coming out of the summer and the post-holiday period. As I highlighted, we've seen that continue into October. As people are back to the doctor's offices, doctors have finished and techs and others have finished the traditional summer holiday period. And so our guidance takes that into account as well as the November and Christmas week impact that we've seen and are well understood in the industry.\\nAnd I will just add, and I'll continue to remind people, we are still very much wonderfully in a launch year. And we are getting to know the market. As you heard Bob and both referred to, we now appreciate that similar to DEFINITY and similar to what a lot of other life sciences companies see, third quarter has some optical vacationality and that does impact total number of procedures that then rebounds in Q4.\\nAnd just to be clear on the math with what Bob was saying is, versus Q2, Q3 had 1 full less selling day, but we see the number of available selling days in Q3 equal to that of Q4. So there will be no impact based on number of selling days for Q4.\\nSo presenters, and ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time, and thank you for participating in today's conference.\\nThis concludes the program.\\nThank you, everyone.\\nAnd you may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":15}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["tx = tx_multi.copy()"],"metadata":{"id":"K-yR7Jap8fWD"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 1) Per-ticker keyword dictionaries (extend as you like)\n","TICKER_PATTERNS = {\n","    \"AAPL\": {\n","        \"pos\": [\n","            r\"\\bapple inc\\b\", r\"\\bapple\\b\", r\"\\bnasdaq:\\s*aapl\\b\", r\"\\baapl\\b\",\n","            r\"\\bticker\\s*aapl\\b\", r\"\\btim cook\\b\", r\"\\bluca maestri\\b\"\n","        ],\n","        \"neg\": [\n","            r\"\\bryman\\b\", r\"\\bmarriott\\b\", r\"\\bhyatt\\b\",\n","            r\"\\bdatadog\\b\", r\"\\bokta\\b\", r\"\\bcrowdstrike\\b\", r\"\\btenable\\b\",\n","            r\"\\bmicrosoft ignite\\b\", r\"\\brsa conference\\b\"\n","        ]\n","    },\n","    \"MSFT\": {\n","        \"pos\": [r\"\\bmicrosoft\\b\", r\"\\bmsft\\b\", r\"\\bnasdaq:\\s*msft\\b\", r\"\\bsatya nadella\\b\", r\"\\bamy hood\\b\"],\n","        \"neg\": [r\"\\bapple\\b\", r\"\\baapl\\b\"]  # light example; tailor as needed\n","    },\n","    \"AMZN\": {\n","        \"pos\": [r\"\\bamazon\\.?com?\\b\", r\"\\bamzn\\b\", r\"\\bnasdaq:\\s*amzn\\b\", r\"\\bandy jassy\\b\"],\n","        \"neg\": []\n","    },\n","    \"GOOGL\": {\n","        \"pos\": [r\"\\balphabet\\b\", r\"\\bgoogle\\b\", r\"\\bgoogl\\b\", r\"\\bnasdaq:\\s*googl\\b\", r\"\\bsundar pichai\\b\", r\"\\bruth porat\\b\"],\n","        \"neg\": []\n","    },\n","    \"META\": {\n","        \"pos\": [r\"\\bmeta platforms?\\b\", r\"\\bfacebook\\b\", r\"\\bmeta\\b\", r\"\\bmeta platforms inc\\b\", r\"\\bmeta platforms,? inc\\b\", r\"\\bnasdaq:\\s*meta\\b\"],\n","        \"neg\": []\n","    },\n","    \"TSLA\": {\n","        \"pos\": [r\"\\btesla\\b\", r\"\\btsla\\b\", r\"\\bnasdaq:\\s*tsla\\b\", r\"\\belon musk\\b\"],\n","        \"neg\": []\n","    }\n","}\n","\n","# 2) Build a predicate for a given ticker\n","def make_is_company_text(ticker: str):\n","    pats = TICKER_PATTERNS.get(ticker.upper(), None)\n","    if pats is None:\n","        raise ValueError(f\"No patterns registered for ticker '{ticker}'.

[Operator Instructions]\\nI would now like to hand the call over to Kate Patterson, Vice President, Finance. Please go ahead.\\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Today's agenda will include a review of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 with Samuel Wilson, our Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Kraus, our Chief Financial Officer.\\nFollowing our prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Before we get started, let me remind you that our discussion today includes forward-looking statements about our future financial performance, including investments in innovation and our focus on profitability and cash flow, as well as statements regarding our business, products, and growth strategies. We caution you not to put undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, as they involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to vary materially from forward-looking statements as described in our risk factors in our report filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements made on this call and in the presentation slides reflect our analysis as of today, and we have no plans or obligations to update them.\\nAll financial metrics that will be discussed on this call are non-GAAP, unless otherwise noted. These non-GAAP metrics, together with year-over-year comparisons in some cases, were not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP metrics to the closest comparable GAAP metric is provided in our earnings release and our earnings presentation slides, which are available on 8x8's Investor Relations website at investors.8x8.com.\\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Samuel Wilson.\\nGood afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025 performance. I want to express my deep appreciation to our global team, our customers, our partners, and our investors. This quarter reflects the grit, focus, and long-term thinking that defines 8x8 and gives me real confidence about where we're headed.\\nBefore we get into the details of the quarter, I want to address a few of the broader market dynamics. While our opportunity remains large, the economic picture has shifted and recent tariff actions and global uncertainty have added more noise to an already complex environment. We're staying focused on what we can control: disciplined execution, platform innovation, and delivering outcomes that matter to our customers. Markets will ebb and flow. But what doesn't change is our commitment to building a durable, cash-generative business that creates long-term value, and that's exactly what we're doing.\\nWe're not dismissing these challenges, but we've prepared for them. Our business model is built on resilience and the results for the quarter reflect operational discipline, business quality, and the flexibility to keep investing where it counts. Our theme for today is simple. The flywheel is starting to turn. After several years of foundational work, we are seeing real acceleration in our core 8x8 revenue, platform differentiation, and strategic execution. This momentum is visible in our numbers, in our innovation, and in the way our customers are responding.\\nLet's walk through 3 key messages we believe define the fiscal fourth quarter and FY '25 and why I'm confident we have a solid future. As many of you know, we began a massive transformation of 8x8 in earnest in fiscal 2023 on the heels of our acquisition of Fuze. We had a clear plan: fix our financial model, invest in innovation and retention, and deliver measurable CX outcomes for our customers. We took bold steps to set the stage. We began paying down debt to increase our financial flexibility, we rebranded the company, and completely rebuilt our go-to-market functions while continuing to invest in innovation.\\nNow, as we exit fiscal 2025, I am confident in saying we are starting to see the results of our GTM rebuild, which is not complete yet. For the fourth quarter, year-over-year growth in 8x8, excluding revenue from all Fuze customers, accelerated to 4.6% from 2.7% in Q3. This is the second consecutive quarter of improvement and marks our highest growth rate in 8x8 standalone service revenue in 10 quarters.\\nWe've also accelerated when looking at the entire fiscal year. For fiscal 2025, 8x8 service revenue, again excluding revenue from Fuze customers, grew 2.8% compared to growth of 1.8% in fiscal 2024. Lastly, as Kevin will discuss, the combined cash flow from operations for fiscal '24 and '25 is the highest 2 years ever at 8x8 and over half our market capitalization as of Friday. We have used the cash wisely, paying off debt and reinvesting in platform innovation that is driving today's growth.\\nHighlights for the fourth quarter include: continued rapid adoption of our communications APIs, also known as CPaaS. The number of interactions surged in the fourth quarter, driving solid growth. The number of customers with 3 or more products increased 13% year over year to more than 700 customers. This reflects increasing cross-sell to our installed base as well as landing more new logos with multiple products.\\nDemonstrating this trend, 80% of our top 20 new logo customers and 2/3 of our top 20 add-on deals included both unified communications and contact centers. We saw strong momentum in sales of our Microsoft Teams integrations, with new license sales up 72% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The cumulative number of licenses sold into Teams environments grew 30% year-over-year and now totals more than 550,000 seats. We also continue to see sizable UC-only deals as customers migrate from legacy vendors, in particular, Avaya, Mitel, and Cisco. We win these deals based on the strength of our unified platform and the initial UCaaS deployment is typically the first phase of a multiproduct adoption.\\nFinally, we made substantial progress in upgrading customers from the Fuze service platform to 8x8. We expect to have all the customers fully off the legacy Fuze platform by the end of the calendar year. I believe these are important signals, especially in the current uncertain environment. We still have a lot of work to do, but we are seeing a steady climb, not just isolated wins. That gives me confidence as we look beyond our fiscal year 2026 into fiscal '27 and fiscal '28.\\nOur second key message this quarter is about innovation, specifically how we've added new AI-based capabilities across our platform, expanded our technology partner ecosystem, and improved usability and accessibility. In the quarter, we introduced a series of platform-level enhancements designed to solve systematic challenges in customer experience, employee efficiency, and digital transformation. Before we go through the highlights, it makes sense to add the context of how the 8x8 platform for CX is differentiated and why it matters for customers.\\nYou already know that 8x8 was the first in the industry to deliver an integrated platform with contact center, unified communications, and communications APIs built into a single cloud-native solution. Agentic AI requires data quantity, quality, and context to deliver on its promise. 8x8's platform for CX delivers all 3 via the customer interaction data platform, or CIDP. CIDP captures, connects, and contextualizes interaction data across the organization and across channels. With fully AI-optimized data, customers are able to unlock the potential of an expanding portfolio of powerful AI capabilities, including intelligent routing, sentiment analysis, live agent guidance, journey optimization, and a host of other capabilities available from 8x8 and our partners.\\nIn early April, we showcased to our U.K. customer advisory council and our global industry analysts, how our unified platform and approach to data differentiated our solutions, and they were notably impressed. We heard comments like, \\\"This feels like a company starting to go on offense, not just cleaning up from the past,\\\" and \\\"Your biggest differentiator might be how you show up. There's a level of honesty and transparency we don't often see in this space.\\\" During these events, we showcased recent innovations, including platform-wide AI chat summarization and composed with AI capabilities. advanced CX solutions that leverage the power of our platform, such as 8x8 JourneyIQ, which gives businesses real-time visibility into the customer journey, not just inside the contact center, but across every department and channel, and 8x8 AI Orchestrator, which connects communications flows using a GUI across systems, ensuring that transitions between bots, agents, and departments are seamless, smart, and contextual.\\nExpanding in omnichannel. We became the first contact center provider to fully integrate rich communication services, or RCS, business messaging, enabling rich, branded, 2-way messaging for digital channels. I'm proud to say we are carrying traffic today, and I'm bullish on RCS. We launched Apple Pay and Google Pay support via 8x8 Secure Pay, streamlining transactions and expanding self-service payment options. We also expanded our technology partner ecosystem, or TPES for short, to provide customers with best-in-breed from single-source solutions. New integrations include: CallCabinet to deliver industry-leading compliant call recording for regulated industries; Spinsci powering EHR-compliant patient engagement in healthcare; and lastly Meltwater allowing social media engagement to be routed, tracked, and resolved within the contact center. As with other TPES partners, these solutions are deeply integrated with our platform and our customer interaction data layer to deliver complete solutions and specific outcomes. This allows the customers to punch above their weight and deliver tailored omnichannel customer experiences typically available only to the largest enterprises.\\nOur platform strategy, continued innovation, and our focus on outcomes is clearly resonating with customers. Let me highlight a few wins. A prominent U.K.-based travel company who chose 8x8's platform for CX for its seamless communication and collaboration across the organization, combined with the scalability and global reach, to power their ambitious expansion plans. They are deploying 8x8 Work, Contact Center, and Voice for Teams. A homebuilding products company where our success was driven by our compelling AI vision and the ability to consolidate multiple legacy systems. Our team delivered a tailored, impactful demonstration that showcased how 8x8 could simplify operations and deliver the features they need. A leading U.K.-based mortgage lender, where we demonstrated a foolproof solution that aligned closely with their strategic goals. We stood out from competitive solutions with a unified user experience and tangible cost benefits. Products included 8x8 Voice for Teams, 8x8 Contact Center with enhanced IVR, a U.S.-based network of medical clinics where we were able to demonstrate the integration of their EHR system with 8x8 Contact Center, an initiative that the competition was either unable or unwilling to support. Each of these wins and other wins profiled in the earnings deck demonstrate the breadth of our solution. Perhaps most importantly, they showcase our consultative, partner-first approach, solving customer challenges, and delivering outcomes.\\nThe third and final key message is about the multiple transitions we are navigating in an uncertain economic environment. We believe these transitions are essential to position us for long-term durable growth, profitability, and value creation. Let me touch on the largest of these initiatives. First, our go-to-market rebuild and channel evolution. After slashing costs in fiscal '23 and early fiscal 2024, we have rebuilt our go-to-market model around solution selling and partner enablement. This has required making changes in our sales organization and building innovative training and robust processes for accountability, and we're seeing performance improve.\\nThe next initiative is continue to grow our enterprise business while maintaining our installed base of small business customers. We know our innovation strategy and focus on outcome resonates with small-and medium-sized enterprises, and we are investing in targeted programs to reach new logos and expand our wallet share within existing customers. But this does not mean we are abandoning our installed base of small business customers. Investments expanding AI capabilities in 8x8 Work and other UC feature releases, along with resources dedicated to education and customer success, all support this customer cohort.\\nFinally, we continue to upgrade the Fuze customer base to 8x8 platform. We recognize that not all of the remaining customers will make the transition, and we are being conservative in our estimates of the amount of revenue we will retain. Those that upgrade are exceptionally happy and have a net dollar retention rate above 100%. These transitions are not easy, but they're setting the stage for what comes next. As we look forward, we remain realistic about the challenges ahead, but we are seeing signs of a tailwind. Our 8x8 business is growing, and our growth is accelerating. Again, growth is not a straight line, but we continue to believe that high-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit operating margins are achievable in the next few years. Our innovation engine is delivering and our own platform and new products are being adopted at scale. And we are navigating through the current economic conditions while ensuring our GTM and financial foundations are stronger than they've been in years.\\nOur guidance for fiscal '26 reflects the impacts of our decision to close down the Fuze platform and that impact lessens substantially in fiscal 2027. We believe that with continued execution, we can achieve that high single-digit service revenue growth by fiscal 2028, and we believe we can improve each year between now and then.\\nThank you for your continued support. I will now turn the call over to Kevin to take you through detailed financial performance.\\nThanks, Sam. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fiscal fourth quarter earnings call. As we wrap up fiscal 2025, I want to recognize our team's unwavering commitment to advancing our strategic priorities by improving operational efficiency, generating strong cash flow, and driving meaningful innovation. In Q4, we maintained focused execution, prudent cost management, and steady progress on platform innovation, all while navigating a challenging macroeconomic backdrop.\\nThe fourth quarter marked another period of solid performance, including a new record in communications platform usage revenue, strong profit margins, and another quarter of positive cash flow from operations following last quarter's record. Q4 marked our 17th straight quarter of positive operating cash flow and non-GAAP operating profit. We continued our thoughtful approach to debt reduction, making a $15 million term loan prepayment during Q4 and an additional $15 million payment in April during fiscal Q1 '26. With these actions, we have now reduced the principal balance of our debt by over $209 million, or approximately 38% since the August 2022 peak.\\nDetailed results are available in our press release and trended financials on the Investor Relations site, but I'll walk through the key highlights. Unless otherwise noted, all figures aside from revenue and cash flow, are on a non-GAAP basis. Total revenue was $177 million, near the midpoint of our guidance range. Service revenue totaled $171.6 million, also near the midpoint of guidance. Our service revenue, excluding Fuze, grew year-over-year. This growth was offset by the anticipated decline in revenue from legacy Fuze customers. Importantly, we made significant progress in upgrading these customers to the 8x8 platform, reducing the remaining revenue on the Fuze platform to under 5% of service revenue, down from approximately 11% in Q4 '24. The pace of these upgrades has accelerated over the past few months, and we remain on track to complete the transition by the end of calendar year 2025. This will further simplify our operations and enhance customer engagement. These results underscore the resilience of our core business even as we address the Fuze-related headwinds.\\nGross margin for the quarter was 69%, at the low end of our guidance range. This was driven by revenue mix, as lower-margin platform usage revenue grew to approximately 13.5% of total revenue, up both sequentially and year-over-year. The gross margin of our underlying subscription business remained healthy and consistent with prior quarters. Our total operating expenses remained in line with prior periods, reflecting our continued approach to responsible cost management. As a result, we delivered 10% operating margin at the high end of our guidance range. We also made meaningful progress on GAAP profitability, marking our third consecutive quarter of GAAP operating income, an important milestone. Stock-based compensation declined to 4.6% of total revenue, a multiyear low, down over $22 million year-over-year and nearly $50 million, or 55%, over 2 years, reflecting our shift to primarily cash-based compensation for most employees, which is captured in our non-GAAP operating income.\\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended Q4 with $89.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, down approximately $15 million sequentially due to the term loan prepayment made in the quarter. The Q4 balance sheet reflects $11.6 million in current term loan liabilities, net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs, corresponding to $12 million in principal payments due over the next 12 months. Following our $15 million prepayment in April, we have no remaining short-term debt obligations for fiscal year 2026, with the next scheduled quarterly payment due on June 30, 2026.\\nOur net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.7x, down from over 6x in fiscal Q2 '23, enhancing our financial flexibility for strategic execution. We also reported stockholders' equity growth for the fourth consecutive quarter, underscoring steady progress in strengthening our capital position. Our remaining performance obligation ended at $780 million, up approximately 1% year over year, reflecting the strength of our multiyear contractual commitments and a healthy recurring revenue base. We generated $5.9 million in operating cash flow in Q4, building on a record Q3 and bringing full year cash flow to $63.6 million, within the $61 million to $65 million range provided last quarter. Over the past 2 years, we've generated more than $142 million in operating cash flow, highlighting the strength of our business model and our ability to fund strategic investments while evolving into a solutions-based CX platform.\\nWhile cash flow may fluctuate due to seasonality, investment timing, and other factors, we remain committed to disciplined capital management in support of long-term growth and shareholder value. We continue to invest in simplifying how customers and partners engage with 8x8, enhancing our direct channel and digital go-to-market strategies and strengthening our technology ecosystem through advanced AI integration. With a focus on mid-market and enterprise customers, we're equipping our sales teams with new enablement tools and training while expanding our use of AI and automation across both front- and back-office functions to drive productivity and efficiency. These investments are central to unlocking long-term operating leverage, enabling scalable engagement, reducing our cost base, and supporting sustained revenue growth and profitability.\\nAs we fund these growth initiatives, we expect some near-term pressure on non-GAAP operating margin. However, with over $60 million of debt retired in fiscal '25 and an additional $15 million prepaid in April, our quarterly interest burden has meaningfully declined. As a result, we expect non-GAAP net income to remain stable even with modest margin compression, supporting consistent bottom line performance while positioning the business for long-term growth.\\nWe continue to manage our cost structure with a focus on efficiency, aiming to balance stability with support for growth and innovation. Our target expense mix is roughly 14% to 15% of revenue for R&D, 33% to 35% for sales and marketing, and around 10% for G&A. At the same time, we maintain flexibility to adapt spending as needed, an important advantage in today's uncertain macroenvironment. For fiscal Q1 '26, we are guiding as follows: service revenue between $170 million and $175 million, total revenue between $175 million and $182 million, and non-GAAP operating margin between 9% and 9.5%.\\nIn fiscal Q1 '26, we expect interest expense, including amortization of debt issuance costs, to be approximately $4.9 million based on current interest rates and our outstanding debt balance. Cash interest paid is projected to be around $2.6 million, as the semiannual interest on our 2028 convertible notes is not payable during the quarter. Our term loan interest rate assumption remains at approximately 7.3%, reflecting SOFR plus 3%. We anticipate fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.07 to $0.09, and operating cash flow between $5 million and $6 million.\\nFor fiscal year 2026, our guidance reflects the range of potential outcomes given ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and FX volatility, especially with about 1/3 of our revenue generated outside the U.S. For the full fiscal year 2026, we are guiding as follows: service revenue is expected to be between $682 million and $702 million; total revenue is expected to be between $702 million and $724 million. Full-year operating margin is projected between 9% and 10%, translating to non-GAAP operating income of approximately $67.5 million at the midpoint of our full year revenue and operating margin guidance.\\nAs I noted earlier, even with the year-over-year step down in operating margin, we expect our non-GAAP net income to remain relatively stable with fiscal 2025, given the expected reduction in interest expense. We expect fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.34 to $0.37 for the year, assuming approximately 144 million average diluted shares outstanding, and we anticipate cash flow from operations to be between $40 million and $50 million for the full year.\\nTo close, I want to thank our employees for their ongoing dedication and execution. Fiscal 2025 was a year of meaningful progress, tightening our operating model, delivering consistent profitability, and strengthening our foundation for growth. As we enter fiscal 2026, our priorities remain clear: focused execution, invest in scalable innovation, and continue delivering value for our customers and shareholders.\\nWith that, I'll turn it over for Q&A.\\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Peter Levine of Evercore.\\nMaybe can you share with us what you're hearing from your field reps, from your partners in terms of the macro impact? Is it sales cycles? Is it just a delay in spending? Maybe just give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing and hearing from the macro side.\\nSure, Peter. It's Sam, and thanks for the question. Look, I'll give you a little bit of a play by play, right? So in March, as the tariff stuff -- and April was really taking off, we noticed in the U.S., I don't know, for lack of a better word, a bit of chaos. Some was elongated deal cycles, some was shrinking of deal size depending on the urgency around the need to switch. So if you were at end of contract with an on-prem provider and those kinds of things, you did a deal, which might have been smaller than you originally wanted, or you broke it up into more phases and those kinds of things. As this quarter has been rolling out -- so April was a little bit of all over the place and May has been a little calmer. I don't know how you guys feel on the equity market side of the house, but it's just been a little calmer in the old U.S. technology side of the house. In terms of the rest of the world, I don't know, they just ignore us. I mean it seems like internal to us, it felt like, at least to me, 2 different markets. There was the U.S. and the rest of the world, and the rest of the world was chugging along.\\nAnd then maybe can you clarify -- I know there's a lot of going on with the changes to the go-to-market. You said there's still some that needs to be addressed, or you're still working through a few other changes. Maybe just walk us through what remains in terms of your go-to-market? And then maybe just, Kevin, real quick, can you give us like an adjusted service revenue growth for fiscal '26, excluding the Fuze?\\nOkay. So Peter, it's a work in progress. So we took a company that focused basically 100% of its business 4 years ago in the notion of buy what you're buying today in the cloud to buy a solution and an outcome around customer engagement from us. And so that's required a complete rebuild of the sales and marketing engine. You'll notice it in our rebrand, you'll notice it in how we structure our sales organization, all those kinds of things. A lot of the heavy reorganization work has been done with the work at SKO this year, we've launched our new sales processes and things around more solution selling and outcome-based selling. And now it's just a matter of fine-tuning the engine.\\nI would say we're 60%, 70% of the way through that, but it takes a while because you know the deal cycles, right? They're 9 months. So as we launch these things, we get to sort of see 7, 8, 9 months later to see how well they've taken and how it's working. And so I think that's a lot of fine-tuning that I would expect over the next year.\\nYes. And Peter, in terms of the revenue growth, excluding Fuze, so Sam mentioned in the script also, it was 4.6% year-over-year, and it's an increase from the growth from Q3. So we're a positive grower, excluding the Fuze business.\\nHe also wanted fiscal year, which is what I gave you.\\n3%-ish.\\nYes, 2.9%.\\nYes, 2.9%.\\nI think he's asking for next year, though. Yes, he's asking, actually -- he's asking [indiscernible]. He could have gotten that out of the script. He really wants to know what you're forecasting for next year.\\nGot it. My mistake, Peter. Yes, I don't have the number handy, but it'd be a positive growth rate. The headwinds go away next year. So we should have a positive number again.\\nOur next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho.\\nCan you hear me?\\nYes, we can.\\nSo just wanted to follow up on your growth for next year and year after. You talk about even driving to high-single-digit growth. How much of that's mostly driven by the go-to-market changes that you're planning to do versus customer demand environment, like customers started spending? Because the reason I'm asking is we are hearing from some of your peers about growth deceleration mostly in the CCaaS and UCaaS space. So would love to hear your assumption on that growth reacceleration.\\nSo I don't think it has anything to do with the market. We never really forecast the market is going to substantially change its growth rate. We generally forecast whatever the most recent third-party analyst estimates are for the growth rate for the market. We really base it on the fact that we've got, as we said in the script, significant increase in the number of multiproduct customers. So over half of our subscription revenue is now with customers with 2-plus products, and we see a better retention rate with those. So that will flow through the model. We're continuing to sell our new products. That flows through the model. We've continued to expand our distribution. That flows through the model. And we're restructuring and improving our performance of our GTM spending. So that will flow through the model. So really, our growth rate, I would say, I use the term loosely inside the company is inside our 4 walls, not outside our 4 walls.\\nAnd then, Kevin, I look at your guidance for cash flow, and I understand some of the investments you are doing. But if I see the margin contraction versus operating cash flow contraction seems to be a bit more. Could you walk us through what's your assumption, and how should we think about the cash flow part of the business for fiscal '26?\\nYes. So look, I gave a $10 million range on that guide. We are making the investments that we've been talking about here on the call. These are good investments in growth and so forth. And our focus also is on the ability to keep our net income flat to stable with previous periods. So I think it's just a function of the investment, maybe a touch of -- I'm not going out on a limb on the forecast for the cash flow guide, but we're comfortably generating a good amount of cash flow for next year. So it's kind of a measured approach to the guide on that.\\nOur next question comes from the line of Catharine Trebnick of Rosenblatt Securities.\\nTwo questions, Sam. You've really been focused on the products on the CCaaS piece of the business. Now why are you winning? And then what specific piece of your product is driving those wins? And then the follow-on is, looks like from the deck, you did a really good job in the U.K. landing a lot of customers. And you also have a lot of VARs and resellers in the APAC region. And what's the status of how CPaaS is doing in that region?\\nAll right. Multiheaded beast there, Catharine. So let me address, why do we win in contact center? I would say, first and foremost, we have a complete solution. And if I summarized it in one sentence, it's you can get best-in-breed technology from a single vendor. So with a combination of our contact center plus our technology partner ecosystem, we're bringing out a Gartner Magic Quadrant player in contact center and workflow. We've got add-ons from companies like Cognigy and Verint and Calabrio and PCI Pal, et cetera. And we wrap it all in bundles that achieve customer outcomes.\\nAnd for our core market of mid-market enterprise and above, that is a really powerful message. They don't have a lot of developers. They don't want to spend a fortune on a systems integration contract. They just want to go to a single vendor and buy it one throat to choke, but they're not willing to give up the fact they want great performance from their products. And we give them the best of both worlds, one throat to choke, one integrated platform, native-feeling integrations, and a compelling commercial offer to put it all together and have us deliver it in beautiful professional services on top of it.\\nOkay. Yes, the U.K. did great last quarter. We've got some new sales leadership there that's doing fantastic. We've improved our execution there. And as always, I'm really proud of our U.K. operations. We've been in the market since 2013 and continue to do exceptionally well in that market. And it carries a higher retention rate and higher conversion rates than we get in the U.S. And just a huge shout-out and credit to the U.K. team.\\nAll right. I saved the best for last. The CPaaS team killed it again last quarter. They continue to do fantastic. Communications APIs or platform APIs continue to be a high-growth business for us relative to everything else. And we continue to invest in there and expand it. Big believer in CPaaS. We continue to see it as a core part of our business. And as we like to say, we're not a UC company, we're not a CC company, we're not a CPaaS company. We're a business communications company because one of our strongest advantages overall in the marketplace is that we offer all those technologies under one roof, fully integrated.\\nCatharine, can I do a cheat on you here? Can I expand the question slightly?\\nYes, you can.\\nWe were the first contact center company to announce RCS integrated with the contact center. So we have 2-way RCS traffic currently being carried right now in real time, and I'm super proud of that because I think it shows when someone invests in buying our products, they're investing in that journey and that vision of where we're going, and that's just a prime example. So thanks for giving me the freebie to call that out.\\nOur next question comes from the line of Michael Funk of Bank of America.\\nSam, Kevin, I want to go back to the comment about high-single-digit revenue growth by fiscal year 2028. I'm just trying to tie that back to this year, right? So Fuze was less than 5% of revenue. That's baked into the revenue -- [ full ] revenue guide for the year and the sunsetting by year-end. But then off of that, what takes you to the high-single-digit revenue growth? Is it just -- I mean, is it increase in seat count at customers? Is it larger wallet share? Are you assuming stable and increasing pricing? Just trying to figure out what takes that customer spend or the revenue growth to the high single digits, even once Fuze rolls off by year-end, assuming that you [ transfer some of those over. ]\\nAll right. I'm going to give you the strategic overview, and I will let Kevin give you any follow-on details that he sees fit. All right, so as we roll this year, so fiscal '25 that we just finished and fiscal '26, we'll have the headwinds of Fuze. And that actually rolls into fiscal '27. So it's less of a headwind, but as we roll off the last customers, et cetera, right? So core business, we're growing 4.6%, is that what I said? 4.8%, I forget.\\n4.6%.\\n4.6%. I forgot the number. 4.6% core business, that starts to shine through. And that's been accelerating as new products and those things take hold and lift that business up. So once we get Fuze out of the way, that will add -- and the new products continue to mature, that continues to grow. You were asking a question about wallet share, et cetera. As we roll out more and more new products, and I think we're going to reach a crossover point here shortly. Well, we've already reached a crossover point where 2-plus product customers are over 1/2 our subscription revenue. We're going to reach a crossover point probably sometime in the next 3 or 4 quarters where 3-plus-product customers surpass 1-product customers. And we do see a substantially higher renewal rate and retention rate when we do that. And so those things start to lift. And as you know, in these SaaS business models, Michael, it takes a little while to get that to shine all the way through. So we get Fuze out of the way, we get the core business continuing to show a higher sustained retention rate. We continue to land new business and grow -- our new business is greater than our churn, and so that will continue to make the pool grow bigger. And eventually, the math sort of works out to high single digits.\\nAnd one thing I would add on top of what Sam said is we also have this rapidly growing usage-based business on top of all that recurring revenue. So it can inflect very quickly than it has. And so that contributes to the growth rates we expect in the future.\\nOne more quickly, if I could. So Sam, you made a lot of progress on the balance sheet on the expense structure, including stock-based comp. I know you mentioned go-to-market among other things. But where has your focus shifted now that you've made it through those first priorities on your list? What's top of your list week to week?\\nGet back to growth, right? So we've accelerated -- I talked about this 2 quarters ago. We accelerated the shutdown of Fuze. We're on track to do that by the end of the year. That helps those numbers shine through, right? Because there's this prevailing belief that somehow we're going out of business or something. I don't know that the long-term discounted cash flow value of the company is 0 or however you want to think about it. And so I think I need to get that to shine through. So I've been accelerating that, been investing for growth, we're investing in CPaaS and those kinds of things. And then eventually, as we get into fiscal '27 and '28, we'll start to invest a little bit more around distribution and improving those things.\\n[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall of Morgan Stanley.\\nThis is Jamie on for Meta. I think maybe just firstly, it looks like you guys are still seeing some pretty strong growth in the new product side, but that maybe slowed a little bit from the 60% or so clip that you'd seen in Q3. So just any specific callouts there?\\nYes. We did see a little bit of a slowdown in the new product growth. It didn't accelerate. I think that was a function of the macroeconomic environment, the compares, the numbers getting bigger, all those sort of things cobbled together.\\nAnd then just similarly as a follow-up, maybe just unpacking the sequential step-down in RPO. Is that more macro related or something that would be attributable to the acceleration in the Fuze transition?\\nYes, it's just Fuze transition mainly. As we accelerate that, we're rolling off some of those things.\\nThank you. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Sam Wilson for closing remarks.\\nDidn't he say he had another question?\\nYes. He said, he'll jump back in queue, I thought I heard him say. Okay\\nAll right. Thank you so much, everyone. We'll follow up with anybody. Kate Patterson and [ Asia ] are available from Investor Relations to follow up in any form or fashion. Thank you so much to our customers, our partners, our employees, and everyone for joining us on this call today, and have a great day.\\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.\",\n          \"I am Tim Arcuri. I'm a semicon analyst here at UBS. Very happy to have Qorvo next, and we have Frank Stewart, who's the SVP and President of the ACS (sic) [ ACG ], the Advanced Cellular Group. And we have Dave Fullwood, who is the SVP of Sales and Marketing. And of course, we have Doug DeLieto who runs IR.\\nSo maybe we'll just start, Frank, maybe you can just give a general overview of sort of some of the dynamics driving your business, you've done pretty well with a large customer this year. Maybe you can talk to some of the dynamics happening in Android. There's some improvement. But yet, I think a lot of investors are questioning how sustainable that improvement can be. So if you can talk to all that, that would be [ good ].\\nYes. Yes, sure. To jump in, I would say, yes, we are excited looking into next year. It's nice to finally see some rays of optimism in the market. And I would say, as we look into next year, we do expect some modest growth in the handset space, which is a nice change from some of the pessimism we've gone through the last couple of years, especially in 5G, which is a big driver for Qorvo.\\nAs far as positioning, Qorvo is very well positioned at both Android and iOS. On the Android side, we've been able to successfully and largely work through the channel inventory headwinds that we've had, and those are now turning into nice tailwinds for us because over the past year, while we've worked through channel inventories, we've actually grown our share in the Android space. And that's thanks to the products and technologies that we've leveraged and we put that together with our customer relationships, which span multiple years of consistent engagement with these Android players.\\nSo we've talked about the products that we're developing that come out of that. So we're excited about some of the most native and highly-integrated products that we've ever delivered that are -- we're going to be able to leverage that as part of our growth next year.\\nAnd what do you think so -- so obviously, you did -- your content this year with a major smartphone vendor was up nicely. Do you think that's a sustained trend? Or do you think there were some dynamics around the product launch that maybe helped you gain that share? I'm just kind of wondering whether you think that, that share can be sustained?\\nYes, definitely. So just like all of our customers, we work for multiple years, usually 3-plus years on the architectures and products that we bring forward to our customers, this one included. So it's never a situation where it's something new or different or changed at the last minute. It's pretty well known.\\nThe areas where we've enjoyed some nice growth in content this year have been areas where Qorvo is strong. So we've been able to leverage areas of strength. We've been able to leverage areas where we've got multiple generations of success. So yes, I do feel good about our sustainability there. But I would also add that even in spite of our increasing content this year, I would say, and we've said publicly that even after the gains this year, we are still underrepresented at that customer, and we're excited about what we can do and how we can grow going forward.\\nAnd so you don't -- there's sort of some narrative that there was a -- because there wasn't a modem change that, that somehow caused more reuse of some older -- or it didn't cause as much change in the RF configuration, and so there was -- there's some implication going around that, well, maybe this is like a one-off. But it sounds like that's not your view it all.\\nYes, that doesn't resonate for how we see the world. I would just say that is a very performance-driven customer that is going to drive us and everyone in the value chain to deliver good performing products year-after-year and what we were able to do and what we were able to capture this year is the result of years of technology development and product development for them.\\nIf I look at your Android business, at least by our math, back in the peak of the last cycle, just in China Android, you were doing $400 million to $500 million a quarter back then. And now you're very low, probably less than $100 million a quarter by our math. What's the right -- I mean, how much of that is inventory burn? So like what's the right normalized number? Do you think it's conceivable that we could get back to that number? I mean, it seems like that was a pretty heady period. But I'm just kind of wondering how much you think that your current revenue is understated because of channel burn?\\nYes, it's a good question. And we don't break it out as a specific number. But what I would say is that we are comfortable that we finally largely gotten through the channel inventory correction. And something that I did want to also highlight, as we work through the channel inventory correction throughout this year, we've actually grown our revenue on a sequential basis over multiple quarters in China. And we've actually gained share through that period as well, which positions us very well for next year because that share we've gained is technology, product and relationships, and we feel confident that we're going to hold that position.\\nAnd I think there was a question about this on the last earnings call, but I would be remiss if I didn't ask about Huawei and the risk of that at least optically them gaining share would pose to the -- not just you, but everyone really. Do you see that as a risk? And I think some of your peers have bought the phone and they've torn it down and they say, \\\"Well, this is actually like a 4- to 5-year old technology.\\\" So the risk of share shifting is minimal. So sort of how do you come out in all that?\\nYes, it's a good question. I mean it is correct to summarize that there are some significant performance challenges with that phone. We would agree with the summary that our peers have talked about there. But even past that, if you just look at the data, the most recent data that's publicly available and that most people use as data sources indicate that it's past the peak. From everything we see and what the data shows, it appears to be a normal phone launch.\\nWe've since seen that all of our customers -- we've seen Xiaomi have a fantastic flagship phone launch. We've seen Vivo doing really well with the new smartphone they brought out. The data shows that Apple is doing well in China in the most recent weeks. So we think that's a past dynamic, Dave and I happened to -- we were in China last month, and we were able to meet directly with all of our customers. We were able to sit around the table with CTOs and CEOs, we were able to hold the different phones we talked about. We feel really good about our position there. And like I said, throughout this time, we've actually grown our revenue in China. We're going to do that again this quarter, and we've gained share.\\nSo I think that all speaks for itself.\\nTim, I'd add 2 things. One, just I forgot to say that our statements today, like the safe harbor language, that applies to our press releases also applies to today's presentation.\\nOur revenue, I think on the call, I got lost that we were doing so well, even as we're burning down the channel inventory growing, like December will be about 2x March, right? There's been good growth all year. We had some peers talking about like more near-term growth. We've been growing throughout the year, so feel good about that. And like to your earlier question, a lot of investors ask what's normal. There is no normal to us. There's seasonality, but there's no normal, like a 2 handle on China Android is not inconceivable, right, at all.\\nGreat. Maybe one more data point. All of our customers that I talked about, the Xiaomis and the Oppos and the Apples of the world, they're all doing really well in other geographies as well. That same data source I talked about showed some nice strength in India as well, by the way.\\nAnd so when you guys -- and I don't know, Frank or Dave, if you want to take this one, but when you win -- on the cellular side, when you win, I mean, obviously, at the large U.S. customer, it's technology, technology, technology. That's it. Cost is not a big piece of it. But in Android, how much is cost a piece of it? Or is it a technology discussion also in Android?\\nDo you want to take that one?\\nYes. And it's -- so performance and size are 2 critical parameters. The innovation never stops, right? So -- but -- and this is true in even our largest customer. There's many other things that matter in their decision-making; quality, supply, how well we support them year in and year out. And that's especially true, I think, in our Android customers. You can't just show up with a good part and a good price and expect to win meaningful share, right? And so we've been that trusted supplier for all of our customers for many, many years, right?\\nLike Frank mentioned, we were just in China sitting across the table, talking about road map 3 years out, right? And so we've been doing that and providing that kind of support to our customers. So that's meaningful, and that's why we're the global strategic supplier to all of those customers. And so it doesn't always come down to just the performance. The performance always matters, but all these other things add up and matter as well in their decision making. It's very hard to say in any one socket that we won for one individual reason. It's usually a culmination of all those things.\\nThat's true in our other markets as well. You take defense, for example. We've been a trusted supplier to the U.S. government and the defense primes for years for technologies like gallium nitride and gallium arsenide as well as foundry services. And more recently, we're a trusted assembler with our advanced packaging technology, which is U.S. based, in our Texas location. So that's a great opportunity for us there as well. And so the same theme plays out really across all of our leading customers and end markets.\\nMaybe a couple of additions to that real quick. Our Android suppliers care deeply about performance and quality, as Dave said. Just in the last few weeks, we've received 2 awards that we're pretty proud of. One is a quality award that we got from one of our China customers as their #1 quality RF supplier. A second one, one of our China customers did a broad supply chain award ceremony, one RF supplier was selected as the Top Innovation award winner and that was Qorvo.\\nGreat. So I don't know if you saw these news articles today, but there's some speculation that the top smartphone customer who's been pursuing their own modem is ending that pursuit, can neither confirm or deny that. But if in theory, that was the case, does that at all change your outlook for being able to keep your content at that customer or not keep the content? And I guess, asked a different way, are you agnostic to whether -- to the modem itself?\\nYes. So obviously, we can't comment on any rumors related to any of our customers, especially that one. To your question on what we're doing in our developments, in our road maps with them for multiple years I would say, yes, we're confident and excited in our opportunity and dollar content available to us independent of how that ebbs and flows.\\nI mean even if you took MediaTek versus Qualcomm, you're pretty agnostic in your attach to a MediaTek modem or a Qualcomm modem.\\nYes. I mean just in general, when we develop RF products, almost all the time, almost any time we develop a product for our customer base, we make sure it's compatible with any and all chipset providers.\\nGreat. Can you talk about where we stand on millimeter wave? Sort of what's your outlook? And do you think that it ever really becomes broadly commercialized?\\nYes, it's interesting. I would say maybe just from our exposure on the ACG side, so millimeter wave in phones, it's not relevant to our revenue base today. It's not an area where a differentiated RF is used today, so maybe just to clarify that. As far as an end market, millimeter wave is still in phones and used in a small percentage. I think the prevailing wisdom is that it has maybe a niche place in some highly concentrated population environments like ball games and concerts per se. If it ever becomes broader and something that gets more substantial usage and thus drives the need for a better RF solution, we've got great technologies that would be available.\\nSo you're not investing dollars per se in millimeter wave solutions. It's just that if it happens, sure, it's great for you. But...\\nYes, I would agree with that summary.\\nOkay...\\nAnd keep in mind, we have a lot of other product areas that we're investing in the technology in defense and other areas, for example. It's just we're not applying that technology right now in the smartphones.\\nRight. Got it. I guess for CSG and HBA -- sorry, HPA. Dave, can you just talk about some of the things that are driving those businesses from a sales perspective? What are the key growth vectors upcoming in those businesses? And maybe based on what you see on the sales side, are these -- are you -- not to put you on the spot, but are you kind of more or less excited about the growth in those markets versus in ACS?\\nYes. And maybe I'll start first with the -- [ reiterate ] the growth targets for each of those segments. So Frank [ said ] kind of mid- to high single-digit growth; HPA, double-digit growth and CSG in the high double-digit growth.\\nBut I think the one thing that excites me is all of our end markets, including the smartphones are enjoying multiple growth drivers, including technology as well as generational upgrade cycles. So Frank talked a lot about the smartphone space and what's going on there in 4G and 5G, 5G Advanced, et cetera.\\nBut if you look at our other businesses, I talked a little bit about defense, but we've got increasing defense budgets there, increasing funding for onshoring. That benefits us because the technologies I mentioned around GaN and GaAs and our advanced packaging. We've talked on our calls about this trend of one-to-many. So if you think about one GEO satellite going to many LEO satellites, low-Earth orbit satellites, where you think about one plane going to many drones, right? So you have to really shrink all the electronics. And so that means more semiconductor content, more challenges for us to solve for our defense customers. And their next-generation platforms as a result of that are heavily focused on size, weight and power, right? And so there's lots of opportunities there. \\nAnd they're moving towards disaggregated and highly networked architectures. So that puts more pressure to have smaller sensors and more functionality that we can go target there. So defense business has been a strong business for us over the last couple of years for obvious reasons, but we continue to see a great outlook for that business.\\nIn infrastructure, it's been challenging for the near term for sure, with all the inventory correction that we're still working through. But there is an underlying upgrade cycle going there. If you look at the base station market outside of China, there's still a lot of room to grow in terms of 4G to 5G transition, just like in the Android ecosystem for smartphones.\\nAnd in broadband, we're the leading supplier there, and there is a transition going from DOCSIS 3.1 to 4.0. So we're getting a lot of orders coming in now as that transition is starting to occur. So once we get through this macro environment and the inventory is behind us, we still believe there's good growth drivers for those businesses.\\nAnd then our power businesses there's a massive trend towards electrification. Critical need for improving efficiency across many of our end markets, so that's going to increase our content opportunity. Battery management systems are another area that we're investing in, and we see a ton of opportunities across a lot of our end markets there. And then the SAM for our silicon carbide JFET architecture is enormous. And so we're quite small today, but we have the lowest RDS(on) in the industry. That's a key performance parameter. And with that, we're delivering improved performance, and we're getting good traction in automotive, data center, energy storage and other markets.\\nCSG, the biggest business we have right there -- right now is the WiFi front end. And that's also undergoing a transition from WiFi 5 to 6 to 7. And so as you move through that, that means more RF content, more challenging modulation schemes, MIMO. And so there's nice content growth there for us in WiFi. Connected home, Matter is going to standardize the protocol interfaces in the home. We think that's going to accelerate the smart home adoption. And we've got a great solution there and a portfolio of products and system solutions to support BLE, Thread, ZigBee and Matter. So we feel good about that.\\nAnd then ultra-wideband is a really exciting area for us. And it's been slow. The adoption has been much slower than we thought. It's kind of stayed in the very premium tier of the smartphone space so far. But more recently, we see automotive as the key driver there. So all of our automotive customers now are starting to integrate ultra-wideband into the vehicle. And it's not just for secure access. It's for presence detection inside the car. It's for ranging and for radar, lots of other applications. So you could have multiple anchors of ultra-wideband inside the car. And if it's in the car, you're going to need it in your phone. So we think that that's going to drive the adoption in the phone as the automobile starts to adopt more and more ultra-wideband. So we feel really good about that.\\nOur MEMS-based sensors, we believe they're a disruptive alternative to touch user interface. And so we see a lot of great opportunities there. Automotive, smart interiors, we've talked a lot about on our earnings calls, true wireless stereo headsets of smartphones, wearables, track pads and many other devices. So we see that as a good long-term growth opportunity for us.\\nAnd then in automotive, we've got a complete portfolio of RF connectivity devices from vehicle to everything, 4G, 5G, WiFi, and I talked about the ultra-wideband. So a lot of good growth drivers, a lot of upgrades going on across all those markets. So we feel good about the underlying growth potential in all those businesses. We've just got to get through the macro environment. And we feel good about the fact that in WiFi and smartphones, most of the inventory correction is now behind us. Still some challenges to go in some of the other markets like infrastructure.\\nSo just on that point, I mean, if you listen to some of the other peers in your HPA business, they don't -- they don't sound very good. So would you agree that, that probably -- out of all the segments, that probably takes the longest to recover?\\nYes, yes, definitely. And the biggest challenge for us there is probably in the infrastructure space. That one is going to take the longest to recover. I mean our power business, some of that inventory correction is behind us. Some of it is still in front of us. If you think about appliances and power tools, those kinds of spaces, there's probably still some inventory out there to be worked through. But yes, it's going to take longer. Certainly, smartphones move much faster. WiFi is more similar to smartphones than a lot of those other markets.\\nTo put a finer point on it. Our base station revenue the last 4 quarters has been down more than 50% year-over-year. We've already absorbed those headwinds. So it's -- we're just waiting on the inventory consumption.\\nGreat. And I guess, can you kind of double-click on your opportunity in autos, I don't know.\\nYes. No, automotive is a really exciting market for us. And we're pretty small today in automotive, when you look across all of our businesses. But we have a lot of content opportunity there. So if you start with power, we've got the silicon carbide JFET solutions, think DC-to-DC converters, onboard charging or even the charging stations. The traction inverter is an opportunity for us longer term, but we don't have a lot of product focus for that today.\\nUltra-wideband is seeing broad adoption, I talked about in the car, and that's a great opportunity for us. We talked in our latest earnings call about a win we have in Europe with a Tier 1, and that's lifetime value for just that one opportunity, is over $250 million lifetime. But we expect that platform to move to other OEMs as well, so that will grow from there. So that's a great opportunity for us.\\nI talked a little bit about automotive connectivity. We announced for our V2X portfolio. We've got another marquee win and another Tier 1 in Germany that will be ramping this year. So that's an exciting growth opportunity for us. And then we've got many design wins with our force-sensing touch solutions in the automotive cabin, whether that's on the steering wheel or the dashboard or controls for the door. Especially in EVs, everybody wants just more futuristic interior in the car. And so our force touch solutions really helps to enable that.\\nSo like I said, the revenue is relatively small today, but the opportunity is pretty big. It takes a little bit longer because it's automotive, but we're excited about that opportunity.\\nI guess Frank, back to you. So Dave, you mentioned the 4G to 5G transition. And there's still actually quite a bit of opportunity. I think we in the investment community, we think, well, the conversion to 5G has already happened. But you still have quite a bit of opportunity out there, particularly in China, the 4G to 5G conversion. So can you talk about that?\\nYes. Definitely. And I would first say, even in the flagship space that is already 5G, the level of innovation has not slowed down. What our customers are asking us to do in the RF space, in flagship, in the new content we're bringing to the table is on the same rapid curve that we've been on for a number of years. So we're super excited about the flagship space and what we get to deliver there and our opportunities and what that growth means to us.\\nAdditionally, and maybe to your point, in the mid and entry tiers, we're going from a place where -- especially in the Android space, less than half of the phones in Android are 5G today. And going forward, we see we see that increasing double-digit volumes every year for the foreseeable future. And for Qorvo, that means going from 4G where we have very little content to go into 5G, where we have a significant content opportunity.\\nAnd if I could, maybe a couple of product examples of why we're so excited about this. I mentioned in the flagship space, we see the innovation engine continuing at the same pace that we've been at in past years. Next year, we're going to bring out a mid-/high-band product. So this is one of the major product categories for us in cellular, where it's going to have the most content we've ever put in an MHB. So a global mid-/high-band able to support every frequency band in the world, plus a secondary RX path. So a bunch of RX content that's never been in an MHB before. So it's going to have more BAW content than we've ever had in an MHB product. So we're really excited about that one, just an example of what I'm saying in the flagship space, innovation is not slowing down.\\nAnd then in the entry tier, a highlight for you on a product we're really excited about. We've taken the MHB that we do for the mid- and entry tiers, and we've integrated all of the low-band content needed into -- in a phone into that MHB, same footprint. It saves over 40% board space for our customers, and we think that product is going to help in this 4G to 5G transition that we're enjoying in that mid-entry space.\\nAnd just on that point, how much -- I think we all worry about competition from China. And how much of a factor is that? I mean, for discrete solutions, I mean, not so much for integrated solutions, but how often do you see China being competitive for anything that you're trying to compete for?\\nYes. I would say just in general, the competitive landscape, including any competition from local China-based suppliers has been pretty stable, not just over the last few years, I would say, over the last 15 to 20 years. There's always competition in our space. We enjoy a position as the preferred strategic RF supplier at all of the customers we serve across -- in the Android space. And especially when you think of Honor and Vivo and Oppo and Xiaomi and Samsung, the players we really know well. As we were mentioning, we were sitting next to CTOs last month in China, talking about road maps for CY '26. I mean it's a pretty special seat at the table we have to do that.\\nAnd just to add -- I'm sorry, just a data point to add on like depreciation for the migration to 5G within the Android ecosystem. It's still 42%, maybe of total Android units, 5G and it will be maybe 48%. So even next year, right, fewer than half, right? So it's calendar '27, '28 before it's 75%, 80% of Android units, 5G. So a lot of opportunities. So even next year, that's 50 million-ish new units entering our SAM and then a bigger number the next year entering our SAM.\\nAnd is there some way to think just a totally rule-of-thumb way for each of those units that converts? What's the -- not that you win everything, but like what's the incremental content for you?\\nWe tend to get 30%, 40%, like not 50%, but north of 30% share on average, on $10, $12, $14 of content.\\nAnd that's the -- yes.\\nYes, that's the Android opportunity. Yes. And we're not a major player in 4G. So it's not like...\\nRight...\\nIt's not like incremental but true content.\\nAnd one other thing to keep in mind is our China customers, they all have global brands and global businesses, and they have aspirations to continue growing globally. So they don't look at the supply base or they don't look at us as a supplier relative to whether we're different from a competitive landscape versus a local China player.\\nIn fact, they count on us, right? We're their chosen global strategic supplier, right? So you have to remember, they also have global businesses and they want to grow in Europe, they want to grow in Southeast Asia, and everywhere else as well.\\nSo maybe just maybe just [Technical Difficulty].\\n[Audio Gap]\\nYes. So I mean, GaN is a great technology. I mentioned the importance of that in our defense business. And so that's a critical technology going forward for us that's going to help us continue to grow that defense business. It's also important for our base station business. So we've talked in a few press releases and earnings calls recently about our GaN PAMs, which is a more highly integrated module for the base station market.\\nAnd so we had some early design wins with our newest products there. And so we used to be a major player in GaN for Huawei when it was discrete, prior to the band, right? And so that business has gone away. And so now we have opportunity to start replacing that business with some of the more global players with our new PAMs. And it also plays out in some of our other markets across the infrastructure and other areas as well. So it's a really important technology.\\nRight. Like DOCSIS 4.0, in that business.\\nMaybe just to give you one last chance here, Doug. So what's the single thing as you talk to investors? I mean, your stock trades at a very, very low multiple. So what is the factor sitting here? You talk to investors all the time, what's the thing that you think people are really missing? Like what's the single biggest opportunity that when you talk to investors, people don't fully understand?\\nSo we've got great representation across all the OEMs and on smartphones, great representation in our other markets. We're bringing specialized technology that really does improve the end market, right? On efficiency and form factor and throughput, no matter what you're measuring, right? I don't think it's grasped, the opportunity that is available to us given that skill set and the underlying market growth that we see in the markets we're targeting, right?\\nAgain, like great content opportunity accounts that aren't growing and great opportunity in the accounts that -- where you are seeing great growth, in the markets where you're seeing growth like Android versus other areas. And then outside of that, the investment businesses, just the opportunities we have in ultra-wideband and all the markets that are developing like sensing, like the silicon carbide, automotive, we're pretty much subscale in a lot of these businesses with great growth opportunity.\\nBut fundamentally, smartphones being ex growth? Yes, we concede, right? It's been 5, 6 years, we've been talking about that, but 5G units in Android, great opportunity.\\nWell, again, thank you to all of you.\\nThanks, Tim.\",\n          \"Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. First Quarter 2026 Earnings Conference Call.  As a reminder, this call is being recorded. \\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mark Dedovesh, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Finance. Please go ahead.\\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Boot Barn's First Quarter Fiscal 2026 Earnings Results. With me on today's call are John Hazen, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Watkins, Chief Financial Officer. A copy of today's press release along with a supplemental financial presentation is available on the Investor Relations section of Boot Barn's website at bootbarn.com. \\nShortly after we end this call, a recording of the call will be available as a replay for 30 days on the Investor Relations section of the company's website. I would like to remind you that certain statements we will make during this call are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect Boot Barn's judgment and analysis only as of today, and actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on a number of factors affecting Boot Barn's business. \\nAccordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. For a more thorough discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the forward-looking statements to be made during this conference call and webcast, we refer you to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements that is included in our first quarter fiscal 2026 earnings release as well as our filings with the SEC referenced in that disclaimer. We do not undertake any obligation to update or alter any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I will now turn the call over to John Hazen, Boot Barn's Chief Executive Officer. John?\\nThank you, Mark, and good afternoon. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. On this call, I will review our first quarter fiscal '26 results, discuss the progress we have made across each of our 4 strategic initiatives and provide an update on current business. Following my remarks, Jim Watkins will review our financial performance in more detail, and then we will open up the call for questions. We are very pleased with our start to fiscal '26 as first quarter results significantly increased compared to the prior year and exceeded our expectations. First quarter revenue increased 19% to $504 million, and consolidated same-store sales increased 9.4%. \\nIn addition to strong sales growth, merchandise margin rate increased 180 basis points compared to the prior year period. The strength in sales and margin, combined with solid expense control, resulted in earnings per diluted share of $1.74 during the quarter, which equates to 38% growth compared to the prior year period of $1.26. The team's ability to deliver strong top and bottom line results reflect the execution of our 4 strategic initiatives, which I'll now spend some time discussing. \\nLet's begin with new store growth. We opened 14 stores in the first quarter, ending the period with 473 stores across 49 states. Our new stores continue to exceed expectations across all geographies and are projected to generate approximately $3.2 million in annual revenue and pay back in less than 2 years. We are on track to open 65 to 70 new stores this year in both legacy and new markets. \\nIn addition to strong revenue in their first year of operation, new stores are also helping drive same-store sales growth once they turn comp. New stores opened over the last 6 years currently comprise approximately 40% of our comp store count and have outperformed stores opened prior to 2019 by approximately 350 basis points over the last year. resulting in more than a 100 basis point tailwind to consolidated comps. \\nWe are very pleased that our new stores are continuing to attract new customers and grow sales after their initial opening, which couples nicely with our sales and customer growth in legacy stores. This underscores the growth potential of our new store initiative as we believe we have the market potential to double our store count in the U.S. alone over the next several years. \\nMoving to our second initiative, same-store sales. First quarter consolidated same-store sales grew 9.4% with brick-and-mortar same-store sales increasing 9.5% and Store comp growth was driven by an 8.5% increase in transactions and a 1% increase in units per transaction and flat average unit retail. From a merchandising perspective, we saw broad-based growth across all major merchandise categories in the first quarter, led by the combined ladies Western boots and apparel businesses, which comped positive mid-teens. \\nThis was followed by the combined men's western boots and apparel businesses, which comped positive high single digits. Our denim business, which is included in the figures just mentioned, comped positive high teens. Our work boots business comped low single digit positive and our work apparel business comped high single-digit positive. We are extremely pleased to see the broad-based growth across categories continue through the first quarter. \\nFrom a store operations perspective, I am proud of the team's performance, delivering strong results and best-in-class customer service during an especially busy quarter. \\nIn the first quarter, the team was able to open 14 new stores, navigate the complexity of several large-scale remodels and work through labor-intensive reticketing on third-party goods. I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to the entire field organization for their hard work and dedication. Moving to our third initiative, omnichannel. In the first quarter, e-commerce comp sales grew 9.3% and bootbarn.com, which is approximately 75% of our online sales comped low double-digit profit. We are very pleased with the momentum in our online business and the continued innovation from our omnichannel team. The team is actively advancing its AI initiatives, including the rollout of our new AI-powered search functionality on our websites. \\nBoot Barn now leverages AI to enhance product copy, support store associates through our cast D assistant, develop multimedia training modules and power the new search experience. In addition to improving our technical abilities, the team's focus on being a store's first organization continues to generate benefits. More than half of our online orders are being fulfilled by the stores, which helps increase merchandise margin and provides the customer with a broader assortment of merchandise to shop. \\nBuy Online Pick Up in Store and Ship to Store have both reached record levels, which will drive increased traffic to our stores, help to reduce shipping costs and improve customer loyalty as we encourage them to shop both in-store and online. \\nNow to our fourth strategic initiative, merchandise margin expansion and exclusive brands. During the first quarter, merchandise margin increased 180 basis points compared to the prior year period. Remarkably, merchandise margin rate has increased approximately 630 basis points over the last 6 years or over 100 basis points per year on average. First quarter exclusive brand penetration increased 250 basis points to 40.6% of sales. I am proud of the team's commitment to drive sales growth while increasing merchandise margin and growing exclusive brands. From a marketing perspective, we are using the creative teams outstanding content to further support our own exclusive brands, starting with our leading work brand, Hawks. In the first quarter, we launched a new website and marketing campaign for Hawks that focuses on work boots and clothing for blue collar workers across industries. \\nWe are encouraged by the early returns and the positive results give us confidence to move forward with our strategy to market our exclusive brands directly, and we expect to launch a direct marketing campaign later this year to support our leading men's brand at Cody James. \\nI'd now like to provide a recap on our pricing strategy as it relates to tariffs, which remains consistent with what we shared on our call in mid-May. We have received third-party cost increases from our vendor partners and our field organization has begun reticketing these items to reflect the new MSRP. We expect the reticketing of third-party items to be completed by the end of August, resulting in maintaining merchandise margin rate. \\nFor exclusive brands, we are planning on hold -- we plan to hold off on price increases until the fall in order to gauge price elasticity. We will then review exclusive brands by individual style to determine if we should raise or hold price on certain items, which could result in giving up margin rate in order to maintain or gain market share. \\nNow turning to current business. We are 4 weeks into the second quarter of fiscal '26 and we have continued to see broad-based growth as consolidated same-store sales increased 11.7%, driven by an 11% increase in transactions and a 1% increase in average unit retail. While we are pleased with the start to our second quarter, we are mindful that July was the softest month of the second quarter last year. We remain cautious of overall consumer sentiment and macro uncertainty, and we'll continue to manage our business prudently. \\nI would like now to turn the call over to Jim.\\nThank you, John. In the first quarter, net sales increased 19% to $504 million. The increase in net sales was the result of the incremental sales from new stores and the increase in consolidated same-store sales. The 9.4% increase in same-store sales is comprised of a 9.5% increase in retail store same-store sales and a 9.3% increase in e-commerce same-store sales. Gross profit increased 26% to $197 million compared to gross profit of $157 million in the prior year period. Gross profit rate increased 210 basis points to 39.1% and when compared to the prior year period as a result of a 180 basis point increase in merchandise margin rate and 30 basis points of leverage in buying, occupancy and distribution center costs. The increase in merchandise margin rate was primarily the result of better buying economies of scale, lower freight expense and growth in exclusive brand penetration.\\nThe leverage in buying, occupancy and distribution center costs was driven by lower incentive-based compensation and lower distribution center labor cost in the current year period, partially offset by the occupancy cost of new stores. SG&A expenses for the quarter were $127 million or 25.1% of sales compared to $107 million or 25.2% of sales in the prior year period. SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales decreased by 10 basis points, primarily as a result of lower incentive-based compensation in the current year period, partially offset by higher marketing expenses due to timing. \\nIncome from operations was $71 million or 14.0% of sales in the quarter compared to $50 million or 11.9% of sales in the prior year period. Net income per diluted share increased 38% to $1.74, which compares to $1.26 per diluted share in the prior year period. \\nTurning to the balance sheet. On a consolidated basis, inventory increased 23% over the prior year period to $774 million and increased approximately 2.7% on a same-store basis. Total inventory increased as a result of adding 15% new stores and growth in exclusive brands. We feel good about the health of our inventory and our markdowns as a percentage of inventory are below last year and below historical levels. During the quarter, we purchased approximately 78,000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $12.5 million as part of our authorized $200 million share repurchase program. \\nWe finished the quarter with $95 million in cash and 0 drawn on our $250 million revolving line of credit. \\nNow turning to our raised outlook for fiscal '26. We are increasing full year guidance due to our first quarter results and the strong start to our second quarter. We are maintaining our original guidance for the second half of the fiscal year, which assumes that the uncertainty around tariffs and the resulting impact on consumer spend will result in flat comps in the second half of the year and unmitigated tariff expenses will increase our cost of goods sold, resulting in a merchandise margin decline in the second half of the fiscal year. The supplemental financial presentation that we released today outlines the low and high end of our guidance range for both the full year and second quarter. I will only be speaking to the high end of the range for both periods in my following remarks. \\nFor the full year, we expect total sales to be $2.18 billion, representing growth of 14% over fiscal '25. We expect same-store sales to increase 3.5% with a retail store same-store sales increase of 3.0% and e-commerce same-store sales growth of 8.5%.  We expect merchandise margin to be $1.10 billion or approximately 50.3% of sales, a 20 basis point increase over the prior year period, which includes exclusive brand penetration growth of 160 basis points. \\nWe expect gross profit to be $812 million or approximately 37.2% of sales. We anticipate 50 basis points of deleverage in buying, occupancy and distribution center costs due to the occupancy of new stores and 50 basis points of leverage in SG&A. Our income from operations is expected to be $277 million or 12.7% of sales. We expect net income for fiscal '26 to be $206 million and earnings per diluted share to be $6.70.  We plan to grow new units by 15%, adding between 65 and 70 new stores during fiscal '26. \\nWe expect our capital expenditures to be between $115 million to $120 million, which is net of estimated tenant allowances of $35 million. And for the balance of the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be 26%.  As we look to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect total sales at the high end of our guidance range to be $495 million and a consolidated same-store sales increase of 6.5%. We expect the merchandise margin to be $249 million or approximately 50.3% of sales, a 70 basis point increase over the prior year period which includes a 250 basis point increase in exclusive brand penetration. \\nWe expect the gross profit to be $178 million or approximately 36.0% of sales which includes 60 basis points of deleverage in buying, occupancy and distribution center costs. Our income from operations is expected to be $53 million or 10.7% of sales a 130 basis point increase over the prior year period. We expect earnings per diluted share to increase 34% to $1.27. \\nNow I would like to turn the call back to John for some closing remarks.\\nThank you, Jim. We are very pleased with our first quarter results and the positive momentum that has continued into the current quarter. We continue to be confident in our ability to execute on our 4 strategic initiatives and drive growth in the current fiscal year and over the long term. I would now like to open the call for questions. Operator?\\n[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.\\nGreat. And congrats on the next quarter.\\nThanks, Matt.\\nSo John, could you speak to drivers of demand strength in the first quarter and elaborate on the acceleration in July, notably the double-digit transactions? And then if you could just walk through the bridge math to flat comps in the back half of the year.\\nYes, absolutely. Yes, as you said, Matt, we went from -- the transactions went from 8.3% in Q1 to double digit in July. So almost all of that Comp growth in July was driven by transactions. AUR was up 1% in July as some of those price increases have started. The performance was really broad-based. It was strength across all of our regions. We saw positive comp trends throughout July across all major merchandise categories, but the 1 worth calling out is denim. We continue to believe that denim is going to be -- we're going to be a denim destination. It's a standout category for us, especially on the women's side, across both third-party brands that we carry and our own exclusive brands. And we delivered double-digit growth in both men's and women's denim during the quarter. But that transaction growth, I have to give credit to our team, both from a store operations side and how they convert those customers in store as well as the marketing team that continues to lean into cultural moments that really resonate with our customer. \\nLooking to the back half of the year, as we said on our first call, we had applied a hair cut to Q3 and Q4 to those flat comps -- and we still believe, given all the noise around the macro environment that there will be could be some softening of consumer demand during that time. That flat comp in Q3 and Q4 is not a result of solely mid-single-digit price increases on our third-party brands, but rather the macro environment continued to be somewhat at risk.\\nGreat. And then maybe, Jim, as a follow-up, could you speak to what you saw on markdown levels relative to a year ago in the first quarter and then here in July? And what's embedded in your merchandise margin outlook as it relates to promotional activity and pricing in the second quarter and back half of the year?\\nSure. The markdowns have continued to be low, pretty low or very low, I should say, when compared to last year and also historical levels, pre-COVID they're very low. And so we're expecting that to continue with us, the markdowns to be low. We feel that our inventory is in a very healthy position. It's fresh. We've got the inventory that we want as we head into the back half of the year in this most upcoming quarter.\\nNext question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Sandler.\\nJohn, you had mentioned around Haw's that you're starting to do some marketing and branding around Haw's. And I know -- I think you did some marketing with Cody James had some concert activity earlier in the year. So I'm wondering if this is a new initiative around exclusive brand marketing? And could that sort of be an early indicator of distribution of these brands outside of Boot Barn over time?\\nYes. Peter, it's when I took the permanent role, we kind of talked about the adjustments I was going to make under the 4 strategic initiatives, which were the sourcing initiative, our exclusive brands and reinvigorating the work business. And the 1 that we've made the most progress on thus far is the exclusive brands piece. It's easier to move quickly on some of these marketing initiatives. We've been very pleased with the early results around Hawks and our ability to advertise the brand using Meta's tools to target blue collar customers, we weren't otherwise be able to target and find. And it's been a pretty material spend over the quarter that's resulted in millions of impressions and over 1 million sessions as well to the Hawk site that we launched a bilingual site in both English and Spanish.\\nCody James at the Morgan Wallan Festival in Gulf Shores, Alabama. It was a great success. We've had a lot of coverage, again, millions of impressions and real views around that concert. And it was the first time we sponsored a stage at a concert with 1 of our exclusive brands. So that was exciting as well. \\nWe're going to -- I've directed the team to take Cody James and mimic or copy paste what we have done with hawks and launch a dedicated site for Cody as well and implement many of the same marketing techniques that we used with Meta's tools, along with some other initiatives, specifically for Cody James. \\nSo I'm very encouraged by the early results. There are no plans currently to sell the brands at wholesale to other companies and other retailers, not to say it couldn't happen 1 day. But for now, we're going to focus on driving these brands at Boot Barn.\\nOkay. Very good. And on the tariff-related price increases, are the supplier price increases kind of the same as when you updated us 3 months ago. I think China and various tariffs have moved around quite a bit. Is it still kind of at that mid-single-digit level. And then it's probably early, but any read on product where prices have gone up, if there's been any demand shifts?\\nYes, it is still that mid-single-digit price increase. We're roughly halfway through the ticket -- the re-ticket in stores. We will be completed by the end of August. And so all the third-party price increases will be completed, as I said, at the end of August, and we're going to hold lower for longer on exclusive brands and see what that price elasticity looks like. It's too early to see if there's been -- we haven't any slowdown in any particular brand because of price increases, you can see the July we had was quite nice. And while an excessive brands performed nicely in Q1, that was prior to any of the price increases. So it's still too early to see the impact of those price increases.\\nNext question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi Group.\\nI want to stick on the existed brand questions for a moment. So could you talk a little bit more about the strategy for that lower for longer pricing? Will you kind of take it month by month to measure elasticity? And then just bigger picture, right? How much bigger can exclusive brand penetration be? It seems like a year where there's a lot of disruption from tariffs. Could we start to see exclusive brand penetration stay above this 40% threshold for some time?\\nYes, it was above 40% for Q1, and we expect it to stay in that range throughout the rest and slightly higher than that for the remainder of this fiscal year. We've said publicly that we'd like to get -- I'd like to get exclusive brands to 50% penetration over the next 5 to 6 years, so 100 to 200 basis points of improvement a year. There may be a larger increase this year with some of the lower-for-longer strategy that we are testing. That window is October pre-holiday or those reticket or price increases on exclusive brands would have to happen post holiday. So if you think of the windows where we either hold or increase prices on some items or many items on the exclusive brand side, it's really October or January are the 2 windows for those price increases.\\nOkay. Understood. And then I guess the follow-up I had, just as we think, maybe, Jim, on the cost side of the business, focusing on SG&A, has anything changed in your thinking around the year in terms of hurdle rate for SG&A through the balance of the year?\\nNo. The hurdle rates still remain where they were when we guided them a couple of months ago. Just a reminder, that we could leverage this year SG&A at a flat comp. And so we've got some leverage modeled in for the year. And at the margin side of things on the EBIT, we expect to leverage that at a 3% comp for the year. And maybe that comes down just slightly because the merchandise margin guide for the year has gone up just slightly.\\nNext question comes from the line of Jay Sole with UBS.\\nIt was an interesting stat you gave on the prepared remarks about how the newer stores are comping better as they mature. And I guess the consumers in those local markets get more aware of them. I think you talked about the stores over the last 6 years, but do you see any nuances between, say, stores open like last year or the year before versus stores that are open maybe 4 or 5, 6 years ago, if you do, can you talk about those?\\nSure. We haven't seen significant differences between the different class years and kind of talked about that a little bit on the most recent call or the last call about how the early open stores in that 6-year period are outperforming the stores in the more recent periods. And so they continue to gain momentum as they age. And as we look at each of those class years, it's a very consistent behavior and improving and really driving comp waterfall, but then also looking at those legacy stores and seeing that those older stores are still adding good volume despite all the new stores that we're adding.\\nGot it. And I guess just thinking about what the productivity per store should be given just a huge growth during the post cohort period and then sort of normalization and then now where we are today. I mean do you feel like it's sort of smoothed out to where you're seeing consistent trends. And if so, what should the average store like a mature store deliver in terms of sales per store in a given year?\\nYes. We haven't put a target number out there. We've talked about it in the past that the new stores open at 75% of a mature store. And so if you do the math, you'd get to roughly at $3.2 million as the sales volume in year 1 for a new store. It's roughly $4.2 million of -- or a more mature store or legacy store. But we plan on growing the comps in those legacy stores into the future. And so that number will continue to go up and the way we're thinking about the business.\\nNext question comes from the line of Max Rakhlenko with TD Cowen.\\nNice job on all the momentum. So first question is on exclusive brands. Can you walk us through the journey of how you're thinking about where product margins can go over time? I think previous comments made it sound like you think that the opportunity to drive upside is quite large. And I think that you do have a new VP of sourcing. So just curious how we should think about that on a multiyear basis?\\nYes. The new Head of Sourcing is on board. Jennifer started a few months back. She's been amazing and a great add to the team, and she's in the process of hiring a full sourcing team here, 10 to 12 folks that we're going to be hiring on the sourcing team. That being said, the gains from sourcing are going to be into mid-'27 -- and for a full year, it's going to be Fiscal '28 by the time we see the gains on the sourcing side. We do think it's going to be over 100 or 200 bps. We think there's an opportunity there, but we are, but that is -- could be multiyear to get there. She's meeting with all the factories. The team is going through recosting exercises with many of the factories. So we're not ready to guide nor commit to what those sourcing margin gains will be, but we still believe that there is opportunity there, and that's why we're building out this team.\\nGot it. That's helpful. And then on the work side, so with that now flipping positive on both sides of that business, do you think that you can maintain that? And do you think some of the challenges are now behind? Or is it more about just easier compares? And then how do you dissect what this set would happen to that business as it used to be pretty steady, pre-pandemic?\\nYes. If we look at all the way back to Q1 of last year, we were a negative 1 in work boots. And in this particular quarter, we were a plus 1 in work boots. It has been very steady. Admittedly, Q4 of last year was the toughest comp at a negative 3.1%. But in general,  it's a steady business. I'm not ready to declare victory on boots by any means yet. It is still comping well below the rest of the business, it traditionally does. It doesn't go up or down as much as some of the other merchandise categories. But I still think there's work to be done on the work boot side. And again, early days of the Hawks initiative, the Cody James marketing will be around the work, the Western and the 1978. So there'll be another hit of Boot Barn work marketing coming as we get into September.\\nAnd hope to have another good update for you guys next quarter. But I don't think it's going to -- there's nothing to indicate that it's going to fall off, but I'm not ready to declare victory that we've gotten work boots back to where they should be in a low single-digit comp for the quarter.\\nNext question comes from the line of Janine Stichter with BTIG.\\nQuestion first for John. Just want to hear your thoughts on the competitive landscape. I know when we were initially going through all this tariff volatility, it seemed like there was going to be a lot of disruption with some of the independents in the market. I'm curious anecdotally what you're seeing in a broader market and if you still see a share gain opportunity from some of the volatility\\nYes. I think we're not uniquely disadvantaged as we look at what's happening with tariffs in the market. Everyone will be facing into the same MSRP increases -- and I think our exclusive brands and the inventory position that we are in heading into our Q3 or the holiday season, puts us in a nice place relative to the competition. Again, this industry -- 1 of the great things about it is it's very rational from a promotional standpoint. And I respect all of our competitors greatly, -- but you do see some of the smaller mom and pops kind of regress and take less risk when they run into these disruptive situation. So I do think we are in a better position than most, if not all,  as we head into the holiday season, given our exclusive brands and given how we've approached the last few months.\\nGreat. And then maybe for Jim, on the gross margin, I just want to clarify when does tariff inventory actually start to hit the gross margin? I'm wondering if we have a period here in Q2 when you have ticket increases, but you're not yet flowing through the higher tariff.\\nYes, that's a correct assumption. So as the price increases go into place on the cost side of things, we're purchasing those goods, but we'll have goods that are in the store that are still purchased at the lower price. And so as we're raising the MSRP that we've been given by the third-party vendors that come along with those cost increases, there is a period of time that kind of in the middle of the second quarter here where we will have a little bit better of a margin opportunity, and you're seeing that in our guide for the quarter as we've got our merchandise margin up 70 basis points. That stays with us maybe to a lesser degree in the third quarter, but a little bit as we head into the third quarter.\\nNext question comes from the line of Jonathan Komp with Baird.\\nI want to ask about inventory. It looks like quarter end, it was up less than 3% on a comp store basis. And just given that you're guiding to flat comps in the back half. Is there a risk that you could actually run to lean or run out of goods that you need based on how you're aligning your buying plans?\\nIt's a great question, John. We feel very good about the inventory flow that we've got. If you think about the positive comps that we've got guided here in the second quarter, you're right. Normally, you would see a little bit higher inventory heading into that period, but we've looked at the inventory that we've got, the inventory that's in transit and on order and feel that we've got enough inventory to handle the guide that we've put out there, but also some upside if we needed to if we have the good fortune of beating the guide that we put out there, we think that we'll be in a good spot.\\nOkay. That's very helpful. And then, John, maybe a bigger picture question. You're clearly putting your own stamp on the 4 strategic priorities. Just as you approach in a few months, 1 year our interim leadership and permanent leadership. Are there any new entirely kind of entirely new initiatives or new priorities that you're considering or just any other thoughts you have on sort of next frontier of growth opportunities?\\nYes, absolutely. No, I I'm comfortable with the big 3 adjustments that we are making now, the sourcing, the exclusive brand marketing and really treating those brands truly as real brands. and then reinvigorating the work, both how we merchandise the work boots in stores, how we talk about work in general and approach the blue collar customer in the tradesmen. \\nSo I catch myself. I think often about different things that we might want to do over time, but it's a lot harder to maintain simplicity and focus than a complexity trap. So sticking with these 3 for the foreseeable future. And yes, there's other things that I think about perhaps as we go into next year. But I think sourcing the marketing piece and work are enough adjustments for the team at this point in time.\\nNext question comes from the line of Chris Nardone with Bank of America.\\nSo just looking at the 2Q guide, can you just remind us what drove the inflection last August in your business? And just whether you're comfortable with the category mix that's driving the momentum as it relates to faster product versus your core products?\\nYes. So as we went back to go back to last year, we saw a kind of a steady increase as we started the year and really, if you look at May, things turned positive in May and then we -- June was positive again, July was general softness in retail. And if you go back and look at our last year transcript, we talked about some toughness in the business from hurricanes and some hot weather out west and different things. And then the business strengthened in August, and we were seeing some broad-based category growth as we look back a year ago in August. And so since August, the business has been in that mid- to high single-digit range really for 12 months now, we had a couple of exceptions February being the most notable. And so as we head into the month of August, we've got the business guided. We think accordingly, it's more in that mid-single digit or low to mid-single-digit comp range for August and September to reflect some of the stronger comps that we had beginning a year ago, but we like where the business is positioned. We think the consumer is pretty healthy. They're shopping with as well. And I think we can carry this momentum at least for the next couple of months. And then John talked earlier about how we're thinking about the back half of the year. beyond that and with some of the pressure the tariffs and consumer sentiment may pose for us. \\nAs we look at -- and I'll just add in, as we look at the fashion side of the business, as you mentioned, the penetration of women's apparel is up slightly versus Q1 of last year, but that's entirely driven by our denim business. And I do believe we're becoming a jeans destination. And so it's not anything kind of truly fashion or apparel that driven outside of jeans or denim that is driving that business.\\nGot it. That's very clear. And I was just in a follow-up. I was curious how big your denim business is today? And then is that pretty well rounded across men's, women's different styles, -- if you can just elaborate on the denim strength, that would be really helpful.\\nYes. The denim business -- sorry, as we look at the penetration of denim, it's roughly half the men's apparel business and lessen that on the women's side. I don't think we share the total penetration of denim typically here, but it's, call it, half of the men's apparel business and slightly less than that on the women's side.\\nNext question comes from the line of Jeremy Hamblin with Craig-Hallum Capital Group.\\nAnd congrats on the strength of the business. I wanted to come to the store openings. You've seen some of the best kind of new unit productivity, opened 14 in the quarter. Wanted to get a sense for the cadence of the $65 million to $70 million guidance for the remainder of the year. Do you expect that to be evenly split? Or any color you might be able to share on that here for the last 3 quarters?\\nYes, absolutely. Yes. So we opened 14 stores in Q1. We plan on opening 16 in Q2, which would get us to 30%. And the remaining of the stores, the remaining stores will open over the back half, and we haven't mapped out exactly how many in Q3 and Q4. So call it the 35 to 40 stores will open in the back half of the year.\\nGreat. And just to dig in a little bit deeper on where you're opening the new stores in that kind of outsized AUV, you're getting at $3.2 million. Is this going to inform how you're thinking about where to put stores in FY '27 and beyond? And have you considered at all even potentially taking a slightly higher unit growth opportunity given how well the business is performing.\\nYes -- great question, Jeremy. We're thrilled with how well the new units are opening I think the 15% growth or new unit openings that we've been doing in the last 3 or 4 years now, it seems to be working pretty well for us. As you know, that number continue -- that results in a higher number of stores we have to open each year. And so I don't see us expanding that on we've already got a the 15% new units just to make sure that we're getting the right locations, we're being patient and not trying to rush those new units and then also operationally, making sure that we're not taxing the field team too much. The distribution center folks and just we're doing it prudently. So I think that, that probably stays where it is for right now and doesn't expand beyond 15%.\\nBut just to clarify, as you look into FY '27 and beyond, you feel comfortable with that roughly 15% unit growth even as the base gets larger.\\nYes. I think we're comfortable with that. It's something that we're always looking at. We haven't guided next year yet. And so we can't give you an exact number of the stores that we're going to put out there, but the 15% is something that we've stated and we've done that for 4 years and feel good about for right now.\\nNext question comes from the line of Sam Poser with Williams Trading.\\nOne, how much -- have you narrowed the assortment within the stores? And if so, how much is a narrow and deeper assortment may be helping you? Or how do you foresee that driving sales and margins going forward?\\nIt's. Yes, I think we have gone deeper for sure in denim. We -- I've been in many stores over the last several months, and I've heard from store partners and managers across the country how much happier they are with the depth of our denim inventory and people can come in and buy make multi-unit purchases in the same size at once, which they struggled with in the past. So I think the place that, that has happened, the most really is denim. I think we're pretty steady state as we look at men's and women's apparel. We do have our tried and true our top styles that drive a disproportionate amount of business that we're always focusing on the top 3% of styles that drive almost 40%, 50% of the business depending on the quarter.\\nSo we are always focusing on those tried and true, but I think the biggest difference is on the denim side and how well inventory we are both in third-party denim and in our own exclusive brands.\\nAnd then within the flat comps in the back half of the year, is that flat in Q3 and Q4? Or do you foresee -- how would you flow that?\\nYes. We have it flat in both Q3 and Q4 -- we stated on the last call that if not for tariffs and macro uncertainty, those would have been plus 3% in Q3 [Audio Gap] and given everything that's going on in the macro environment, we are holding that guidance and we'll update it as we get to the next call.\\nNext question comes from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies.\\nI just wanted to ask on price increases. Is there perhaps like a time line that you could give in terms of when you're expecting to see these price increases come through? And then just on the exclusive brand penetration. Has that changed at all as you've tweaked the pricing across the other brands that you sell in your store?\\nYes. So as we said a little bit earlier, I'll just walk through that time line 1 more time. We have received price increases from many third-party partners or vendors. We've started to reticket those items in stores. We're about halfway done with the reticketing process, and the reticketing will be complete by the end of August. So the price increases, which are mid-single digit that we've received from third-party vendors will be done end of August. \\nWe are holding lower for longer on our exclusive brands, and we really have 2 windows where we can increase price on exclusive brands as well to preserve rate. And those windows are October and then into January, post holiday, obviously, can't do it in November or December. So we're going to see how brand penetration performed against third-party vendors over the course of September and probably the first week or 2 of October and make the call style by style on what we keep lower and maintain pricing on versus what we increase prices on to preserve margin rate.\\nUnderstood. Just no color as of yet based on reactions.\\nNo, it's still early days. With half of these items, roughly half of the styles being reticketed and that was really completed within a week or 2 of where we are right now at the time of this call. It's still too early and haven't seen any change. We had nice EV penetration throughout Q1. So the penetration we talked about was not driven by some dislocation between pricing of EB and third-party brands.\\nNext question comes from the line of Ashley Owens with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\\nSo to follow-up on the exclusive brands questions a bit. I Would be curious at all how you plan to communicate or market some of that pricing differential to consumers over the next couple of months what levers you have in place to drive incremental sales to exclusive brands by choosing to hold those prices? And if it could carry on further past January.\\nYes. We generally don't talk about price. We've never been a very promotional retailer, very full-priced business. And I'm personally, especially from some past experience in other positions I've had at other companies. I'm very careful about being promotional or talking about pricing because it's hard to walk back from that. So we know that many of our customers come to bootbarn.com and they browse the product on bootbarn.com before going into stores.\\nAnd as you filter and look at different products and different price buckets, they'll be able to see that price differential there, but I don't see a world where we're going to be screaming it from the rooftop and putting it in e-mails that were still pre-tariff pricing like you see in the automotive industry and things of that sort. \\nSo I don't think we're going to take the approach that you perhaps have seen and other businesses. That being said, a lot of these prices, especially on the boots side of things. there are psychological price barriers that have been breached with some of these mid-single-digit price increases where now, we have a boot that's under $200 and other boots are now above $200. So I think that will work in our favor. \\nBut I don't think we're going to have kind of a pre-tariff pricing marketing campaign in any way around this. And we'll let the consumer choose and they'll see the pricing, whether they be in stores or they're doing their research at home on bootbarn.com before coming in.\\nOkay. Got you. And then just as a follow-up. We know you're performing really well in denim. It's been seen by some other brands in apparel and really trying to capitalize in on this and some of the denim tailwinds we've seen this over the past week. Just any plans to lean into additional marketing there?\\nWe're doing things in stores. So we're focusing on fit guides and talking about denim in stores and making sure our partners are educated on the different fits and the different rises, especially on the women's side. So denim guides that each store partner will have are going out as we speak. I think they landed in all stores over the last week or so, and they look great. So we're going to be educating partners on denim. And our denim continues to be very much our boot-cut silhouette as you would imagine, given our business and given the footwear or the boots that we sell. And so it really comes down to the rise, the stretch, the different types of boot cuts that continues to sell very well for us. I don't think we're going to have any real kind of denim or gene campaign like others have seen over the last couple of weeks who have [ American Eagle ] and some others. I think we'll continue to market who Boot Barn is and our broad assortment of product that includes denim, but no large dedicated denim campaign in the works right now.\\nNext question comes from the line of Jeff Lick with Stephens.\\nAnd congrats on a great quarter. John or -- John, I was just wondering, what is typically the spread between exclusive brands and the national third-party brands? And how much will it widen here in this interim period? And I'm curious, does your research indicate like just how much does exclusive brand adoption kind of revolve around price or and/or once you try it, you get a lot of repeat customers because it seems like you're running an interesting little test tube here with pricing.\\nYes. The spread between exclusive brands and third-party brands, and we've said this publicly for several quarters is generally 1,000 basis points, is what we've seen up until now. The honest answer is we don't know how much price and especially a psychological price barriers are going to play into the customer's choice. And that's why we're running this kind of large-scale elasticity test. We have the opportunity to stay lower for longer. And EV penetration, while we want to get to 50% over the next 5 to 6 years, 100 to 200 basis points increase per year. It's been our experience that sometimes that isn't a straight line kind of growth, and there has been step function jumps in the past. And let's see if this can be 1 of them, and we don't know how the customer will react to holding these prices. If everything else has gone up and people seem to absorb inflation quite well as they have overall the last 4, 5 years, -- it may not be a factor. But if the boot starts with the 2 and or starts with a 199 or 189, it may make a difference. But that's why we're running this test, and that's why we're going to decide style-by-style where we hold and where we increase price to preserve margin rate.\\nI'm just curious, did you have kind of detailed conversations with different vendors about, hey, this is kind of what you're going to be what we're doing and did any vendors say, \\\"You know what? I'll keep the price the same. I don't want to go through that test. I want to lose share.\\nNo. The vendors have been -- look, they are dealing with a very difficult situation, a very fluid, very dynamic situation, and it's very -- it was all -- especially today on tariff day eve, I suppose. -- it's almost impossible for them to do this style by style. They -- many of the vendors have put these mid-single-digit price increases across the Board to kind of insulate them against these increased costs and tariffs. And so they had to do it across the board and they couldn't -- they're not going product by product or style by style. And so for them to back off of that across the entire industry, I think, would be difficult them to do. But we said it on the last call, and I think most of them are aware that we're taking this tax if they've listened to the call, but we haven't had any of them come back and say, \\\"Hey, we're going to rewind some of those price increases or resin them. That has not happened.\\nThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.
