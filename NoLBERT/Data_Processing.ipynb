Welcome to the Concentrix's Fiscal Fourth Quarter FY 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Sara Buda, Vice President, Investor Relations.\\nTerrific. Thank you, operator, and good evening. Welcome to the Concentrix Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. This call is the property of Concentrix and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without the written permission of Concentrix.\\nThis call contains forward-looking statements that address our expected future performance and that, by their nature, address matters that are uncertain. These uncertainties may cause our future results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future expectations, events or developments. Please refer to today's earnings release and our most recent filings with the SEC for additional information regarding uncertainties that could affect our future financial results. This includes the risk factors provided in our annual report on Form 10-K and our other public filings with the SEC.\\nAlso during the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted free cash flow, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, and constant currency revenue growth. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is available in the news release and on the company's Investor Relations website under Financials.\\nWith me on the call today are Chris Caldwell, our President and CEO; and Andre Valentine, our Chief Financial Officer. Chris will provide a summary of our operating performance and growth strategy, and Andre will cover our financial results and business outlook. Then we'll open the call up for your questions. And now I'll turn the call over to Chris.\\nThank you, Sara. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 earnings call. Before we get into the details of our results, I think it might be helpful to look at how our business has evolved over the past few years to show why we are confident that we will continue to grow profitably in 2025 and believe mid-single-digit growth is achievable in later years.\\nAs we have stated and provided many examples over the last 2 years since GenAI started to be mainstream, we have executed with intent to focus our offerings on taking advantage of GenAI and expanding into new areas while keeping our underlying business healthy by de-investing in commodity work. As a result, we have more than 2,000 clients, including 155 of the global Fortune 500, with extremely high client revenue retention rate of approximately 99% in fiscal 2024.\\nWe have built a defensible market leadership position as a provider of integrated technology-led business solutions that power our clients' success. This means we have the scale, technologies and capabilities to broaden our market and address the evolving needs of our clients. Our top 25 clients, which are all leading global brands, have an average tenure of over 16 years with us. Our revenue with these top clients continues to grow faster than the rest of our business as we introduce ancillary services and complementary solutions to expand our value and grow our share while automating and innovating work for them.\\nIn fact, nearly $1 billion of our revenue in 2024 is derived from new Concentrix solutions that didn't exist at scale in our business 24 months ago. Solutions such as data annotation, data modeling, analytics, B2B sales enablement, AI design and deployment, cybersecurity, financial crimes and compliance are now today -- and even now with our commercial available software products, combining our revenue from these offerings grew above mid-single digits in fiscal 2024. Additionally, we have our Catalyst IT services offering, which represents roughly 8% of total revenue and is also growing well.\\nAs we have grown these ancillary services and we have also proactively reduced the percentage of our business related to low complexity transactions from 13% 3 years ago to 7% today as we expect to continue to reduce this percentage further in fiscal 2025. And finally, as AI emerged as a business imperative, we have consistently grown and evolved our business to take advantage of this opportunity and use it as a source of differentiation. In fact, with generative AI deployments across half of our clients, approximately 200,000 desktops in our own operations using GenAI, and with tens of thousands of digital workers that are autonomous, we are confident saying that we have one of the larger deployments of AI technology at scale in the world.\\nWe have found that as we deploy our technology to grow revenue faster with these clients, and we are particularly encouraged that as we have completed the Webhelp integration, we have a large pipeline of new clients in Europe who we will deploy our technology in fiscal 2025. While the market focused on the erroneous perception of AI as a headwind for our business, we have turned it into a tailwind, using generative AI to take advantage to create new opportunities while making our traditional business better. We have given numerous examples on our last few calls of how we lead our clients through their AI journey from designing and building their operations to deploying automation and reducing low-value transactions to enhancing their internal productivity.\\nIn doing so, we reduced our clients' total cost while increasing our revenue as they consolidate spend with fewer providers and unlock new sources of revenue for us. This has been the case throughout our history and continues to be the case today. I am delighted with the progress we have made as we have adapted and innovated to address our clients' evolving needs. While we see a clear disconnect today between our underlying fundamentals and our public market valuation, I am confident that as we execute our multiyear growth strategy, our valuation will align with the strength of our business and the value of our distinguished and unique market leadership position.\\nWith this context as a backdrop, let me give you my view of our most important achievements of 2024 and our expectations for 2025. I'll then turn the call over to Andre, who can provide more details on our financials and outlook.\\n2024 was a remarkable year for Concentrix. We integrated Webhelp with Velocity, aligning our sales, marketing, delivery and operations team within the first year. We aligned our cultures around 1 company, 1 team, ensuring we delivered global scale consistently with local relevance and expertise for every client in every location around the globe. We are delighted to say the Webhelp integration is now complete, with ongoing net synergy benefits showing through in 2025 and beyond.\\nWe secured a number of key transformative wins in 2024, both with our own technology and technology from leading partners, and our pipeline continues to be strong going into 2025. We have made prudent investments in our business that we believe will allow us to drive growth and margin expansion in the future. This included founding a new software products organization with strong leadership, enhancing AI tools and technology, and expanding our relationship with partners. And we have our first commercial win with our GenAI IX product suite.\\nAll in all, 2024 was a strong year for Concentrix. We delivered solid financial results, growing revenue well ahead of most peers in the broader BPO and ITO service sector while generating strong free cash flow. We have evolved our business to take advantage of what clients want, fewer providers that can do more and invested more that take global scale and technology capabilities to meet their needs.\\nBut what gets me most excited is the strong fundamental platform we put into place to drive sustainable growth into the future. For 2025, let me be very clear. We expect to grow our revenue, our non-GAAP operating margin, and our free cash flow while paying down debt. We will continue to expand our GenAI offering both from leading companies like Salesforce, Microsoft, and Google and others on top of our own technology in order to offer our client base the best solution for their business.\\nWe'll expand our key relationships by demonstrating the power of Concentrix, combining our design-build-run capabilities and innovative AI-led solution domain expertise and business process excellence to fuel our clients' success. And we will continue to secure new transformation wins that demonstrate the value of our broad-based technology solutions while decreasing our low complexity business.\\nAs we look into the years ahead, I am excited about what we are in our journey to become the world's most trusted partner for business and technology solutions that power a world that works. I'd like to thank our dedicated game changers for their hard work and commitment to excellence and our clients for their trust and their business. Now I'll turn the call over to Andre.\\nWell, thank you, Chris, and hello, everyone. 2024 was a year of significant operational achievement for Concentrix. We integrated Webhelp ahead of plan, culminating in the migration of our financial ERP system at the end of the year. We proactively and intentionally invested in the productization and commercialization of our internally developed products while driving strong cash flow. We reduced our leverage through debt paydown while increasing our share repurchase program and increasing our dividend. And strategically, we continued to diversify and broaden our value to clients through a diversified set of service offerings.\\nWith a successful 2024 behind us, I'm confident in our position as we enter 2025. With that, let me delve into the details of our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 and then discuss our business outlook for fiscal 2025. In Q4, we delivered revenue of approximately $2.45 billion, growing 1.5% on a pro forma constant currency basis, which is at the high end of our September guidance range.\\nLooking at our fourth quarter revenue growth by vertical, on a pro forma constant currency basis, revenue from retail, travel and e-commerce clients grew almost 9% year-over-year, a continuation of the solid growth we've been seeing in this vertical. Revenue from banking, financial services and insurance clients grew 5%, relatively consistent with prior quarters this year. Our recent wins and pipeline give us confidence this vertical will continue to remain strong for us.\\nRevenue from communications and media clients decreased 1% on a pro forma basis, a slight improvement from prior quarters in the year. This decrease in revenue reflects ongoing decreases from a few North American communications clients, partially offset by increases with media clients. Our technology and consumer electronics clients also decreased 1% on a pro forma constant currency basis, as did our revenue from clients in the health care vertical.\\nTurning to profitability. Our non-GAAP operating income was $347 million, in the top half of our guidance range that we provided on our last call. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 14.2%, a decrease from Q4 2023, primarily due to our increased technology spend, upfront investments in some transformational wins, and duplicate costs related to accelerated shore shift in Q4, all of which we discussed last quarter. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $403 million, a margin of 16.5%.\\nNon-GAAP net income was $219 million in the quarter, an increase of about $6 million compared to the fourth quarter of last year, and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $3.26. GAAP net income was $116 million for the quarter and GAAP diluted EPS was $1.72 per share. Reconciliations for GAAP and non-GAAP measures are provided in today's earnings release.\\nLooking at our results for the full year 2024, we grew 2.7% on a pro forma constant currency basis, at the high end of the guidance range we provided a year ago and above many peers. Non-GAAP OI was $1.32 billion, up slightly over prior year on a pro forma basis. Non-GAAP operating margin was 13.7%. Adjusted free cash flow was $475 million. Our free cash flow included spending on integration costs to generate increased synergies in fiscal 2025.\\nWe returned approximately $220 million to shareholders. Specifically, we repurchased $136 million of our common shares, representing 2.2 million shares at an average price of approximately $61.74 per share. And we paid $84 million in dividends during the year. We reduced our net debt by approximately $209 million during the year, and we further reduced our off-balance sheet obligation related to receivables factoring by $46 million during the year to approximately $162 million at year-end.\\nAt the end of the fourth quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $241 million, and total debt was $4.736 billion, bringing our net debt to $4.495 billion at year-end. Our liquidity remains strong at approximately $1.5 billion, including over $1 billion on our line of credit which is undrawn.\\nWith this, let me now talk about our outlook for 2025 and the first quarter. First, as Chris mentioned, we are on an exciting journey as we broaden our offerings to address the evolving needs of our clients. And while the macro continues to affect our business, as it has for all services companies, we expect to deliver growth in 2025 based on the following: incremental revenue from business we won in 2024 that will ramp throughout the year; share gains with our largest clients as they consolidate spend with us because of the capabilities and scale that we offer to meet their business needs; and continued growth in outsourcing as clients seek partners that can help them embrace and adopt AI to reimagine their business while ensuring customer experience excellence, data security and business stability.\\nAs always, these drivers of growth will be balanced by the underlying effect of the macro on our clients' businesses, our proactive automation as we continue to intentionally migrate away from low complexity business, and continued movement to lower-cost delivery countries as we've seen over the past several years.\\nTurning to margins. We expect non-GAAP operating income and adjusted EBITDA margins to uptick slightly as we balance synergy savings with investments to power our future growth. We do expect our spending on software product development to decrease throughout the course of the year. And finally, we expect adjusted free cash flow to grow to between $625 million and $650 million in 2025 driven by synergy savings, lower integration costs and lower interest expense.\\nWith this context, our guidance for the full year is as follows: full year reported revenue of $9.47 billion to $9.61 billion. Our guidance implies constant currency revenue growth for the full year in a range of 0% to 1.5%. Based on current exchange rates, our expectation assumes an approximately 150 basis point negative impact of foreign exchange rates compared with 2024.\\nNon-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.34 billion. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $11.18 per share to $11.77 per share, assuming non-GAAP interest expense of $273 million, approximately 63.6 million diluted common shares outstanding and approximately 5% of net income attributable to participating securities. The effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 25.5% to 26.5%.\\nAnd finally, as a signal of confidence in our long-term growth strategy, the Board has refreshed our share repurchase authorization to $600 million. We expect our spending on fiscal year 2025 repurchases to modestly exceed the pace in fiscal 2024, taking advantage of what we believe is the extreme disconnect between the fundamentals of our business and our current valuation. We remain committed to maintaining investment-grade principles, repaying our debt to move closer to our target leverage ratio, and continuing to support our dividend.\\nFor the first quarter, we expect reported revenue of $2.355 billion to $2.37 billion, implying a constant currency revenue growth rate of 0% to 0.75%. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $305 million to $315 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be between $2.49 per share to $2.64 per share, assuming non-GAAP interest expense of $74 million, approximately 64.1 million diluted common shares outstanding and approximately 5% of net income attributable to participating securities. The effective tax rate in the first quarter is expected to approximate 25.5% to 26.5%.\\nAs in prior years, we expect adjusted free cash flow in the first quarter to be negative although improved as compared to last year's Q1, followed by consistent strong cash flow generation over the remaining quarters of the year. Our business outlook and cash flow expectations do not include any future acquisitions or impacts from future foreign currency fluctuations.\\nWe remain confident in the growth of the business and believe we are taking a conservative position in our guidance for 2025. As we look back on 2024, we're delighted with our market position. We have intentionally and strategically expanded our value to clients by broadening our portfolio of solutions across the spectrum of business and technology solutions. We've embraced the opportunity of generative AI and have established a clear market leadership position that is allowing us to win large transformational programs and drive new revenue streams.\\nWe believe we are making the right investments in the business to future-proof our offerings and position us for growth upside in the long term while growing margins and cash flow. We remain steadfast in our commitments to driving shareholder value through a combination of long-term revenue and margin expansion, having the right capital structure, and continued capital return through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. We're excited about the road ahead. With that, Josh, please open the line for questions.\\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joseph Vafi with Canaccord Genuity.\\nNice to see progress in the business on a lot of fronts. I thought maybe we'd just kind of drill down first on the revenue outlook. Appreciate your discussions on incremental revenue wins, share gains and more volume switching to outsourcers. Just wanted to also get some input on -- I know you mentioned that the less complex work was going to continue to decline.\\nI was wondering if you could provide some commentary on perhaps how many points of kind of revenue headwind that may comprise in 2025. And then also if there's any headwind coming from a geographic delivery mix change from perhaps on-site or onshore to offshore, et cetera? And then I have a quick follow-up.\\nYes, for sure, Joe. So a couple of things. Let's start with the last 1 first. In terms of geo shift and revenue headwinds, we are seeing that from Europe into Africa and Eastern Europe. We are continuing to see that from North America. We talked about that a little bit where we had some health care programs going offshore. Cost for delivery is certainly a big issue with clients. And so we expect that, that kind of offshoring of work will continue.\\nSimilar to what we've talked about as a point, bit of headwind of growth in the last little while. In terms of the low-value transaction going down, our expectation is that we will lower that by another 1% to 2% in the course of 2025 so you'll get down to that sort of 5 percentage range. There's always stuff that kind of falls into that. But we've done what we're really happy with, a very good job over the last year of not growing that, not going after any business that would add to that and continue to automate and drive that down. So our expectation is if you just think of 7% going down to 5% of our business of that type of headwind as we look at 2025 and what we're looking at.\\nGreat. And then maybe more of a detailed update. I know last quarter, you indicated that there was a large transformational win, I believe, where you were going to finance some of the upfront costs there. Just kind of an update on those types of transactions, progress and when they may kind of reverse and start generating revenue and how they may contribute to the P&L in 2025.\\nYes. For sure, Joe. So well, the large transformational deal that we had to upfront some of the costs will start to generate revenue in 2025, but it's more in the sort of third and fourth quarter for it to be more meaningful. There's really not too much in Q1 outside of some costs that are running through, and Q2, we'll start to see some revenue but then it's really on the back half of the year.\\nWe have not done any deals of that size in Q4 that you'll see through, but we have done a number of smaller transformational deals relative to the large one. And they'll start, frankly, generating revenue within Q2 and Q3, but again, more back half of the year. The transformational deals tend to take a little longer just because we have to build out the platform forward to move across, move the work across and then start to drive it. But you're not seeing that sort of upfront capital requirement that we saw with the 1 very large transformational deal.\\nOur next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird.\\nGreat Q4. And maybe first of all, just when we look across CX or BPO or IT, in the last couple of years, businesses have just wanted to spend less, tightened the belt a little bit. We kind of get that. Are we getting to a point where consumers are starting to push back? We have to go through a whole bunch of bots and then finally talk to somebody on the phone.\\nAnd that takes extra time that really we're having, as consumers, to take longer while businesses are getting to lower their handle time? But is there enough pushback that you're starting to see companies say, \\\"Hey, we need to outsource more here, not less because there's consumer pushback and we want to reinvest in service again.\\\" Is that starting to shift back?\\nYes, that's a very interesting question. We see it in certain industries. We see it in BFSI. We see it in some high-value goods. We see it in a bit of auto. Where we don't actually see that pushback from consumers is in telecom for instance or in consumer electronics, for instance, because there's no one really raising the bar high enough that people can do the compare to, kind of maybe a sad state of affairs but that's generally what we're seeing.\\nAnd so where we see businesses really want to separate and differentiate their offering, they're outsourcing more and they're outsourcing more of the tech and they're kind of doing it in a combined manner that really drives a better customer experience. We do think as consumer purchasing power, hopefully, rebounds in 2025, that companies will kind of try to differentiate a lot more. And I think generally, what we're seeing is that probably there will be some human involved in that. And most likely, that human will be in an outsourced relationship.\\nYes, that's great to hear. And then maybe my follow-up. I know you kind of indicated that in the beginning of the call back to mid-single digits at some point. Is there a time frame which you kind of expect to get back to that? Are there indications in the pipeline or anything in the demand environment that you're seeing that would say, hey, we're -- maybe we're only 3, 4, 5 quarters from that? Just a little context around that.\\nYes, for sure. I mean, if you look at what we called out and you just simply take the $1 billion of business that we talked about in the opening comments growing sort of high single digits, when you talk about the Catalyst business, which is growing roughly in that range. And then we have a number of other capabilities within our business growing within that range. You can see that at scale, right, that's a few billion dollars. At scale, we are growing above that single-digit mark.\\nSo clearly, what do we need to do? We need to continue to be faster at automating some of the work that we can get done because we -- when we do that, we tend to win more work. We need to continue to focus on bringing down our lower-value work so that we don't have that overhang within our business. And if you kind of do the math, we talk about other years but it's not multiple years. Our expectation is that getting out of 2025 and if we can continue to drive what we want to drive, then that's something that we should be able to achieve shortly thereafter.\\nOur next question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America.\\nThis is Aisling on for Ruplu. My first question is for Chris. Can you just talk about how your digital CX or Catalyst business is trending? What was the revenue growth year-over-year this quarter? And how should we think about growth in fiscal '25 since you've talked about some potential large deals you're pursuing?\\nYes. So our Catalyst business is doing very, very well. We talked about it being roughly 8% of our business, and we talked about it growing well, which you consider mid- to high single-digit growth through the course of the year. There's some fluctuation in that as we continue to add more partner implementations. Our expectation is that's what it's going to continue to grow. It's one of the bigger growing areas as we implement more and more technology. And we're kind of quite happy with what we're finding with it, and it's adding a lot of value to our overall relationships within our client base.\\nOne for Andre. Can you just talk about priorities for cash in fiscal '25 and how you balance reinvesting in the business versus M&A versus buybacks? Just any color around that would help.\\nSure, happy to do it. So we feel really confident in the free cash flow generation in 2025 and that, that will give us the opportunity to continue doing what we have been doing, which is obviously, first and foremost, investing in growing the business organically and then having the free cash flow left over to continue to pay down our debt and as well as return capital to shareholders. So we feel great about the confidence that our Board has shown in us, in increasing the authorization for share repurchases up to $600 million.\\nWe've said that we'll continue certainly during this period where we feel like there's a disconnect between our valuation and the underlying fundamentals of the business, we'll be active in share buyback. In my commentary, I said we'd buy back slightly more, modestly more than what we've repurchased in fiscal year '24. So you can kind of figure out from that what the priorities will be. Generate the strong free cash flow, share repurchases slightly more than the $136 million that we did this year. Our dividend was $84 million this past year, that we've increased it in the past by 10% each year. We might like to do that again this year. And then with the remainder left to move closer to -- pay down debt to move closer to our targeted leverage ratio.\\nOur next question comes from Divya Goyal with Scotiabank.\\nSo I wanted to further talk about this demand environment that we're talking about here. Chris, could you help us understand the sustainability of these revenues? Obviously, the growth is bleak for fiscal 2025. How should the market get confident in terms of the company returning to, say, even the mid-single digits from a revenue growth standpoint? And if you could potentially also help us understand how should -- how could or should we expect the margins to potentially grow on a go-forward basis?\\nYes, Divya, so a couple of things. As we talked about, we've got a lot of businesses growing within our portfolio that are at mid-single digits, if not higher, and some even higher. And as they get more and more scale of our business, that's what gives us the confidence to believe that we can get to mid-single digit.\\nAs Andre also talked about, if you think about this year ahead, not only are the wins that we've gotten within 2024 that will layer into our business over the course of the year, but we'll also drive down our transactional sort of low-value business from 7% to 6% to 5% through the course of the year. So there are some headwinds to that. But ultimately, we're quite confident that we can grow past that with all the different areas that we're making.\\nAnd the areas that are growing are things that are in demand around generative AI, whether it be the data annotation, whether it be our analytics business. Analytics business is doing very, very well, whether it be some of our GenAI prototyping and tooling and implementation. We've signed up with Salesforce, Microsoft, and Google this year to do more and more partner work. Just certainly expanding and we're happy with that. So there's lots of momentum in the business.\\nAnd as Andre pointed out, we're also being somewhat prudent with our guidance for fiscal '25 because we will do the right thing for our clients, but we also want to make sure that we're messaging to investors, being prudent with what we want to get done. And if there's an opportunity to move stuff offshore that will drive a higher margin for us, we would probably do that, whether it creates a revenue headwind or not.\\nI think in terms of the margin expansion process, through the course of 2024, we were pretty clear about where we were making additional investments, whether it be in our software platforms, whether it be in some of the new capabilities that we're building out with our partners. And obviously, we have to hire, in some cases, a different skill set of individuals for some of the work that we've gotten into, whether it's our financial crime and compliance, whether it'd be some of our BFSI work, et cetera.\\nAnd I think all of those are higher-margin businesses that we are growing and were going well. And so my expectation is that, that will start getting layered in and we'll start to see that grow. And as Andre also pointed out in the prepared remarks, we do not expect to spend the same on our software development this year as we did last year. We told investors that we needed to get everything into a multi-tenant, more commercially-ready state that we would be spending up until sort of the end of the year. And then we would be looking at kind of reducing that spend through the course of 2025, more in line with how we're driving revenue.\\nSo that's our plan. Also 1 thing that we should call out is that we are very happy with the number of IX product sales we got within the first couple of weeks. We've got a very strong pipeline with that. And clearly, that's very low dollar value to begin with, but frankly, it's software margins. And so as we layer more and more of that into our business, we have the ability to grow our margins through that as well.\\nThat's helpful. Maybe I'll just ask 1 more question in the interest of the concerns around the CX sector. Could you help us understand, like with the increased prevalence of agentic AI, how does Concentrix managed services play out? Or what specific role would Concentrix have to play with the increasing prevalence of automation, AI and agentic AI? And that's all for me.\\nYes, for sure, Divya. I go back to our prepared remarks. Like right now, what I think investors don't quite understand is that we have half our clients on GenAI right now. We have literally tens of thousands of autonomous agentic agents doing what they need to do and continue to drive it. These things do require tuning. They do require data management. They do require analytics to make sure that they're doing the right things. There does need to be some regulatory compliance around them, depending on which countries they're deployed on.\\nThere's just a lot of other management that goes around with it. And here, we have grown our revenues, while in the last 2 years, driving GenAI deep into our client base and doing a lot of autonomous work. And what we're finding is that even the big software providers are coming to us to say, \\\"Look, you understand the domain expertise around this. You understand how the systems are built. You have time with all the technology. You understand the data and the domain expertise around what we're trying to achieve. You understand the client relationship. So help us try to figure out how to get our products in there, sell our products in there, and then maintain the products as they go.\\\"\\nAnd so that provides new revenue streams for us that 2 years ago, we didn't have. I think the other thing that we called out in the prepared remarks and sort of our businesses that weren't at scale 2 years ago and now are at scale is even revenue generation. A lot of people are thinking generative AI is simply for reducing costs and taking out costs. We found that clients are actually open to try and figure out how to use GenAI for driving revenues and figuring out how to improve the experience and actually delivering better outcomes for their clients.\\nAnd again, that requires consulting, analytics, and data modeling and data annotation and managed services around that and security and compliance, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And I just don't think that people appreciate, this isn't -- despite the best commercials on TV and as you walk through the airport about how, what and this stuff is, it isn't. And it requires professional services companies to be able to support them.\\n[Operator Instructions] And I'm not showing any further questions. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.\",\n          \"Good morning. Good morning, all. Thanks very much for joining us today. Just some brief housekeeping before we kick off. For those in the room, bathrooms, just round behind the stairs over here. And in case of an emergency, can you please follow the instruction of fire wardens who will make themselves known. We'd also appreciate if you wouldn't mind turning your phones to silent mode. \\nAs we're in Melbourne today or Naarm, its original name, we'd like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land where we gather they were [ Andre elders ] of the collonation and pay our respects to elders past and present. So we're excited to have you all here today and excited to be able to provide some insights into our initiatives across the emerging living sectors of lend lease and build-to-rent and to hear from and to meet some of our team.\\nWe'll start off by providing some research insights and outline the investment appeal of the living sectors and then provide an update on the BTR sector and some of our operational and development takeaways from our journey to date. Then we'll discuss our ambitions for entering the lend lease sector. We'll have a Q&A session at the end. And for those online, you can submit your questions via the web link. \\nSo Mirvac has a rich history as an award-winning residential developer with many repeat customers. However, this is only part of the picture. We've identified a customer need and demand for affordable housing solutions, which has been supported by strong market fundamentals and tailwinds, including rising population growth, record low vacancy levels for renters and affordability challenges.\\nOur existing apartment and master planned communities product are beneficiaries of these fundamentals and our expansion into build-to-rent and lend lease are natural adjacencies. We are pleased to be able to present our customers with a full life cycle of housing options from when they first entered the market as a renter in one of our BTR assets to their first home or apartment purchase, upgrading or downsizing later in life.\\nAnd in time, we will have the opportunity to offer an affordable downsizing solution as our customers head into retirement in our lend lease communities. As you will hear today, living sectors are one of the largest and most resilient real estate investment sectors globally and one of the most sought-after asset classes for institutional capital. We are pleased to continue to expand into these sectors with our partners and drive value for you and our shareholders.\\nAs we've previously flagged, our organization has been restructured into investments, funds management and development to reflect the growing scale of the funds management platform and the integrated nature of our development division. Asset Management has also been separated from investment management to provide independent support to both Mirvac and its partners, hoping to create a better performance-driven culture. \\nWe have a truly integrated business with learnings from our build-to-sell residential, commercial and operational BTR assets feeding into new development designs. Our unique internal design and construction capability is now deeper than ever, spanning commercial real estate and multi-living sectors.\\nWe've already shown leadership in the use of digitization and prefabrication in our development process, and this will become even more important going forward in order to achieve Scope 3 sustainability objectives, meeting evolving customer needs and driving investment returns. Over the past few years, our operational environment has shifted, presenting a number of cyclical and structural changes with a number of the key structural megatrends which we aim to continue to leverage over time to drive value for investors.\\nWe've been executing on our 5 focus areas outlined in April. Our recent noncore asset disposals, new industrial and BTR development completions and our planned expansion into lend lease has further modernized our investment portfolio and solidified its cash flow resilience in line with our strategic objectives. And we continue to make strong progress towards our other objectives. As a best-in-class urban asset creator, we have more than 50 years of experience in creating exceptional places through multiple cycles.\\nThe purchase of a home is the largest investment most people make. Mirvac's reputation a 50-year track record on delivering high-quality, well-designed homes, investing in infrastructure and communities early and continued product innovation means people trust us to deliver on our promises. We have continued to diversify our offering from land, detached homes and terraces through the mid-rise and high-rise apartments.\\nThis means everyone from her first home buyer through to upgraders, rightsizes and investors can benefit from Mirvac's commitment to quality as we respond to demand across all customer segments. We've responded to market tailwinds and expanded our living sector exposure now capturing the rental market and in time, the over-55s market, through build-to-rent and lend lease communities in addition to our award-winning residential cell -- to-sell business.\\nAs customer preferences and value propositions change, our integrated model has allowed us to leverage our in-house residential expertise and apply to these new sectors. Mirvac's competitive advantage lies in our unique integrated asset design and construction capability which creates significant value for our security holders and capital partners. The integrated model that drives Mirvac's advantage can be thought of as a flywheel that delivers development earnings, a pathway to accelerated growth in [ NRV ] and improved portfolio quality.\\nAnd at the same time, enables growth in our assets under management and third-party fee income. In an environment of cap rate expansion and elevated delivery challenges, our value creation platform and track record around site selection, risk management and execution will become an even greater differentiator of performance over time. I will now welcome Alex Gray, our Head of Research, to walk through the market fundamentals.\\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Today, we're very pleased to share some insights on rental populations in our cities. So let's begin with Australia's record migration boom underway. While population data from ABS is quite lagged, we get a more timely read from their labor force survey. And this is showing that the working age population growth is currently running at a pace of 2.8% a year at August 2023, well above the 1.9% pace in August 2022.\\nSo this is clearly the catch-up from lost levels due to the pandemic, and we do expect this to normalize gradually over the next 2 years. However, 2 decades of migration data tells us these groups don't disburse evenly around the country. They overwhelmingly reside in Sydney and Melbourne, with some flow through to Brisbane and other parts of Australia. So what we're looking at here is the impact overseas migrants have on the housing market upon arrival.\\nIt shows the change in settlement patterns in subsequent years. So this is looking at migration data at 2019, and we can see migrants largely enter the rental market on arrival to Sydney and Melbourne. On the left, you can see a rented apartment is the typical dwelling for a new migrant to Sydney, and in Melbourne, both rented apartments, semis and townhouses have been an important product for new migrants.\\nWe expect the shared apartments to rise in Melbourne. In the dark blue there, you can see, given the lift in completions in the recent years in the city here and the rapid absorption of that stock. Final key point to this slide is that we find the tenure of migrants shifts over time from renting to home ownership. And for Melbourne, this is around year 5 from arrival, and you can see the importance of detached housing, something we see ourselves within our master plan communities projects.\\nFor Sydney, it's a longer transition reflecting the affordability challenges and a longer time in the rental market. The Sydney migrants have transitioned from renting to buying through purchase of typically more affordable apartments and townhouse product. And so while the demand side drivers are lifting, so too are the ambitions and targets for housing supply.\\nAt the August meeting of National Cabinet, the National Housing Accord target was increased by 200,000 dwellings to 1.2 million well-located homes to be completed by June 2029. To put this in context, it requires 240,000 housing starts every year for the next 5 years, a pace which this country has never achieved. So the National Housing Accord and the also newly legislated Housing Australia Future Fund policies do not materially impact the near-term outlook for residential construction. \\nWhile some upside exists towards the end of the decade, the challenge to meet these targets is immense and will clearly require a step change. Delivering at scale will require increasing density and addressing that full housing continuum that Campbell just talked about, something we are focused on here. So we see a picture where dwelling completions in our major cities and nationally are cresting peaking over the next few months. And through 2024, the volume of completions is expected to reduce quickly, providing some easing to construction cost escalation though elevated infrastructure spend exists in all our major cities, especially on the East Coast.\\nAnd so that provides some -- that will be offsetting some of that. On the current trajectory, completions of detached houses on the left across our 3 largest cities are expected to fall by more than 25% from peak 2018 levels. However, let's dive into the apartment stock. It is in the apartment stock that the undersupply story is more pronounced. And while we expect a tick up in the apartment supply in the major East Coast cities in FY '24, population growth will also be moving through that peak simultaneously.\\nSo in subsequent years, we see the volume of new apartments and attached dwellings, which is the typical housing stock for renters, expected to be more than 50% below 2017 levels. Risks are also skewed to the downside here because of the highly constrained funding environment, elevated construction costs Campbell mentioned, and we also have lower presales limiting construction. So where does that leave us today?\\nWe look out to the near-term peak picture of a rapidly growing population, sharply lower supply, yet today, vacancy already is at record lows across many submarkets. Apartment rents across our capital cities have clawed back their pandemic impacts and now in the double-digit pace there above inflation. Across our 3 largest cities, renter households have been the fastest growing across all large population age groups.\\nRental households aged 20 to 59 have recorded a compound average growth rate greater than 3% over the past 15 years. While conversely, you can see that outright ownership has declined or held flat. So our rental households are getting older as affordability constraints around obtaining the deposit or servicing the mortgage, see more young people delaying home ownership. According to ANZ and the researchers of the Australian National University, it took 9.9 years for households on a median incomes to save the 20% deposit for a medium-priced dwelling in Australia in September '23. In Sydney, this was 12.3 years.\\nWith dwelling prices now on the rise again across all of Australia's capital cities, this represents a decrease in market buying accessibility for renters. And the time to save the deposit is now on the increase again. As such, we have a growing pool of renters, and they are getting older. You can see the chart on the right is showing a count of households by age over time in the 3 larger cities.\\nRenter households aged 30 to 39 have more than double in 15 years -- almost doubled in 15 years. So as renter households increase, we've also find a growing acceptance and preference for apartment living across all household and family types. These charts here are showing the share of renter households living in a high-rise apartment, which is a structure of more than 4 stories. The largest renter customer groups are on the left side screen.\\nSo top left is our single and group households. And the bottom this chart is showing a couple household with no kids. So the light blue line show the story for Melbourne. In 2006, around 1 in 5 of those renting household types was living in a high-rise apartment. Fast forward to 2021, high-rise apartment was the home of 2 in 5 of those groups. And the charts on the bottom -- and top and bottom right of the screen are our families with kids, so we either got a 2 parent or a single parent family.\\nAnd what stood out to me was the importance and acceptance of high-rise apartments of family living. For example, 15 years ago in Sydney, a high-rise apartment was home to less than 1/3 of all renting 2 parent families with kids. And today, there are now more families with kids renting in a high-rise apartment than any other dwelling type. You can see the other cities are on the same trajectory. Against this background, we think the build-to-rent sector will play an important role in Australia's future housing supply.\\nWhile rents have continued to lift over this past year, the median rent or affordability pressures are generally not to the same extent as borrowers. Conversely, for residential investors, mortgage repayments have climbed higher than median rents and we've seen residential investors become a higher share of for-sale listings in many areas over the past year. And lastly, we also see huge demand for quality housing from older cohorts. Forecast from the recent intergenerational report show the volumes of people in Australia over 55 climbing strongly over the next few decades, almost doubling by 2063.\\nThe potential is there. The 2021 census showed over 70% of Australians aged 50 to 79 living dwellings with just 1 to 2 residents in their home. However, over 80% of those dwellings, they have 3 or more bedrooms up to 40% have 4 or more.\\nAnd we expect growing volumes of households will look to unlock the value of those dwellings in order to fund a quality retirement. I'm very pleased now to hand over to our CEO Investment, Richard Seddon, to speak more on the investment appeal of living sector.\\nThank you, Alex, and good morning, everyone. Over the past 10 years, Mirvac has taken an active approach to portfolio composition, disposing over $4.2 billion of older assets to create over $6 billion of brand-new, highly sustainable, award-winning assets which resonate with customer demand across build-to-rent, industrial and office. This has driven a strong uplift in portfolio quality and operational performance with 97% occupancy across all sectors and outperformance across all time horizons.\\nOur strategic focus is to further improve the cash flow resilience of our investment portfolio by upweighting our exposure to the structurally supported living sectors, build-to-rent and lend lease, continuing to lift our exposure to industrial and moderating our office exposure to more acutely focus on modern high-quality assets. We've made good progress towards these goals with our asset disposals of mostly lesser-quality office assets, progression of our industrial and build-to-rent pipeline with Switchyard and LIV Munro completed in the last 12 months and our planned expansion into land lease.\\nThe build-to-rent asset class is underpinned by compelling structural drivers including extremely low vacancy rates of around 1.5% nationally, robust demand supported by strong forecast population growth, a structurally undersupplied housing market with planning and delivery challenges persisting and stretched affordability increasing the proportion and duration of renting in Australia. This provides an attractive investment thesis producing stable income with high occupancy, diversified tenancy risk and a strong underlying customer proposition, a robust rental growth outlook with attractive supply-demand fundamentals and typically higher inflation protection and low cash flow leakage with modest CapEx, minimal incentives and generally low downtime.\\nAnd it's very aligned to Mirvac's core capabilities, including our deep history of award-winning residential products across a broad range of product types and geographic markets supported by market-leading in-house design and asset creation capability, our deep operational experience in target markets with established customers and understanding of regulatory and customer requirements. And our operating track record with 2 completed assets, providing a first-mover advantage and a wealth of operational data and customer insights from which to draw on.\\nGlobally, build-to-rent has demonstrated strong performance. The chart on the left shows in the U.S., the direct residential sector has achieved strong total returns on a comparative basis with a lower standard deviation or variability in returns during this period. In Europe, cap rates have proved resilient and longer-term returns attractive with lower volatility.\\nCapital is responding with recent surveys of investor intentions demonstrating a targeted upweight in allocation across all major geographies. In Australia, the residential sector is exhibiting much of the same structural characteristics as that witnessed globally. Vacancy rates are materially lower than the other major asset classes with the exception of industrial for which we already have a secured development pipeline and are upweighting our exposure to.\\nRental growth has outperformed other asset classes in real terms with nominal rental growth around 130 basis points above inflation over the past 10 years. We have a structural undersupply of housing with stretched affordability impacting homeownership levels against a backdrop of elevated demand from one of the strongest forecast population growth rates in the developed world of around 1.5% per annum. And our major cities of Sydney and Melbourne are consistently rated as the top -- in the top 10 most livable global cities across a range of metrics, cementing their appeal on the world stage.\\nThis chart indicatively sets out the component parts of potential investment returns for illustrative purposes. Whilst the initial yields are comparatively tight, the attraction of these asset classes underpinned by stronger rental growth, supported by the strong fundamentals Alex outlined earlier. And relative to other asset classes, only modest cash flow leakage from incentives, CapEx and downtime. This delivers an attractive true cash yield, underlying growth profile and lower volatility compared to other asset classes.\\nAdditional ancillary revenue streams are available via the OpCo for value-added services, which Angela will expand on shortly. Through the cycle, we'll continue to maximize development margins in the vehicle to compensate for delivery risk and provide a positive spread between the stabilized yield on cost to cap rate, boosting underlying cash yields and providing asset valuation uplift post stabilization. The balance of Mirvac returns are illustrated on the right-hand side of the chart from investment and asset management services and acquisition and development management services.\\nThe Australian build-to-rent sector is still in its infancy with only 13 operating assets nationally and a total of around 4,000 units. Whilst we're seeing an increase in development activity, much of the potential supply pipeline is yet to receive development approval or commence construction. If all of the current known or potential build-to-rent supply was delivered, this would equate to around 47,000 units or only 0.4% of the total housing stock in Australia.\\nThe potential addressable market is significant. In the U.S., penetration rates are at 12%. And in the U.K., they're at 5.4% with the sector only being established in just over 10 years. By contrast, in Australia, the total completed assets and pipeline of just 4% is just 4% -- 0.4% of an approximately $10 trillion total residential market. If build-to-rent achieved a penetration rate of just 3%, this could result in a $290 billion asset class across approximately 350,000 units, which would be considerably larger than the current office, retail or industrial investable universe.\\nMirvac is pioneering the build-to-rent sector in Australia, having commenced the asset class over 6 years ago, we are now very well placed with 2 operating assets and a secured pipeline well under construction. This operational experience and first-mover advantage will continue to provide great insights into site selection, design, creation and curation of our future assets as we grow our exposure to this sector.\\nAnd we are able to leverage Mirvac's core capabilities, including our rich history in developing residential product to respond to evolving customer demand in the creation of build-to-rent assets. Our deep end-to-end construction and design capability is invaluable. We can utilize our multisector active operational management platform to drive value at the asset level and have a demonstrated track record of delivering investment outperformance across multiple sectors.\\nWe believe these factors will provide us with an enduring competitive advantage with which to drive performance and growth in this emerging sector. I'll now hand over to Angela Buckley.\\nGood morning, everyone. As the team has highlighted today, I'm going to talk to you more about, I think, what really makes up build-to-rent for us and the commitment that Mirvac has made over a 7-year period to deliver in the asset class and what we've learned along the way. We have an ambition to lead the category. As Richard said, we have a first-mover advantage really being backed by 50 years of residential experience, which we can lean on every single day, which the development team will talk to you more about.\\nThis truly integrated business and the commitment to continuous learning has really given us a very strong focus on iterating and operating in this space, which we will, again, we consider through the whole life cycle. Our secured and diversified development pipeline puts us in a fantastic position with all of that pipeline to be operational within by FY '25, which provides a meaningful, scalable portfolio and delivery certainty. And we have the capability and capacity to grow this pipeline with exposure across Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.\\nOur experienced team and proven platform, we believe, really set us for growth into the sector and the opportunity and the runway, as Richard has noted, is significant. Importantly, we've invested heavily right throughout the whole business. We've created a market-leading brand in LIV, and we have a truly customer-centric approach to everything that we do. We have more than 1,100 customers today, and that number is rapidly increasing and will do so over the course of the next year and have now been operating at Sydney Olympic Park for more than 3 years and coming up to our first anniversary in Melbourne.\\nAnd this has really given us great insights proving up operating metrics, maintaining high occupancy, resident retention and customer satisfaction. And we have a really strong emphasis on removing the friction points from people's lives and creating a more enhanced living experience, which we'll talk to you shortly. It's not surprising to say that ESG is at the heart of everything we do and build-to-rent is just an example of this. We have -- we aligned to Mirvac's This Changes Everything strategy. We've achieved net positive Scope 1 and Scope 2 within our build-to-rent portfolio and a commitment to Scope 3 target by 2030.\\nImportantly, for built-to-rent, being able to deliver ESG with social sustainability is one of the greatest opportunities that we see having driving community benefits being central to the LIV offering and also the opportunity to deliver more broadly across the housing continuum and doing so with partnerships, government partnerships to deliver affordable housing like we have at LIV Anura.\\nAnd importantly, over the last 12 months, we've really been the successful establishment of our build-to-rent venture. Importantly, we've taken the next step in creating an aligned partnership with the developed to core vehicle with very aligned investors who also see the opportunity for us to grow and doing so in a way that provides great visibility and transparency and that commitment to grow the portfolio to over 5,000 apartments.\\nHere is a snapshot of the portfolio as it exists today. As I said, we have -- we really think about the portfolio as being over 3 generations. And we were fortunate to have our first project in LIV Indigo at Sydney Olympic Park, which, as I said, has now been operational for 3 years. That, again, has given us really wonderful insights. Since the project stabilized in more than 18 months ago, it has and -- through a COVID period, it's never had occupancy less than 95%.\\nSo it's really being able to and achieved really great leasing results and customer satisfaction as well. Our first foray into Melbourne is what we really consider to be generation 2 of our portfolio. This is a much more purposefully designed build-to-rent opportunity rather than a repurpose build-to-sell development. And again, the learnings, the diversity of the customer and our initial performance results here have been extremely pleasing in outperforming strong market conditions.\\nAnd now we turn our focus really to what's next within the next -- within the next 12 months, we'll be delivering 2 new projects, 1 at LIV Aston, which is -- which you will hopefully get the benefit of seeing today. We pleasingly topped out that project last week, and we're well on our way to completing that mid next year as well as LIV Anura, which the development team will talk to in more detail. And finally, Albert Fields, which is also in Brunswick, which is really our first foray into medium density style development within build-to-rent.\\nYou can see here that all of the ESG targets we have across the portfolio are extremely strong. We're market leading with respect to that. And we really believe we have a -- can take advantage of this going forward. I think importantly, we really believe that this is about creating a new category of housing. This is not just about optimizing renting or trying to bring some attributes of what people -- what customers currently on the -- security, they currently only received as part of being in a built-to-sell style development or being an owner of a property.\\nAnd that is really about putting the customer at the center of everything that we do. We are really about delivering to those deep human needs. Safety, security, connection that really evokes belonging and flexibility that enables individuality. And these are the attributes that really set build-to-rent apart in the customer's eyes start to see the value of what we are delivering and where they can belong.\\nIt is no surprise that if you are a renter in this country, you're not used to being treated as a customer. The current makeup is that really the landlord is the customer of the real estate agent and the tenant is simply the person that pays the rent. And so the benefit build-to-rent model is really about flipping that and putting the resident at the heart of what we deliver and creating an experience centered around that, which we believe will create much more certainty, security for those customers and leads to ultimately why we have conviction that they can deliver stability in the cash flows over long periods of time. How do we do that? How do we deliver that every single day?\\nThere are -- you can see the attributes that we talk to here. But it's starting really -- we know from our customer feedback offering security of 10 year delivers really -- is really important for our tenants. That comes through in a number of ways. It's not just the security of the lease that the customer can choose how long they live with us for, you can rent with us for 3 years or for 12 months. But also what's included as well.\\nSo having a team on site 7 days a week, white goods are always included, you have -- we create removal of friction through the renting process. You can seamlessly connect to WiFi, the electricity is on when you move in. We can offer additional services, which I'll talk to in a moment, and you may never lose a parcel again. And these attributes are really, really important. I think the way that we design the buildings is really centered around creating connection and that belonging.\\nAnd we always say, in the LIV building, you're feeling at home when you walk into the building, not when you open your apartment door. And then importantly, flexibility, and that really enables individuality. We don't just welcome pets. We make -- we encourage residents to paint their walls to ensure that they can hang pictures that they can really make the home their own. And that we can add on or take off what they don't need.\\nSo if you don't necessarily need to own a car park -- own a car to live with us because we can offer a different solution, and that is all part of the value proposition as well and importantly, creating third spaces, spaces that genuinely add to the living experience for our residents. I'm often asked about the pricing of build-to-rent and our apartments and how does that really compare. And I think it's really important to think about it in 2 components. There is the pure financial proposition for the resident. But then how really we think about the other inclusions and amenity and how that really ladders up to -- for the individual customer.\\nI think really importantly here, what we've done is show and something that we've learned through the process is really that our -- we find very regularly residents are prepared to trade down in order to their size. So while they might rent a 2-bedroom apartment in the open market, in the build-to-sell space, they are happy to be in a one-bedroom apartment in LIV Munro. And you can see that quote from one of our customers who relocated from just from Queen Street a 2-bedroom apartment, but have actually found that they feel they have more space at Munro within their apartment because it's well designed, but also because they have access to and they utilize the additional spaces as well.\\nWhat we're doing here is just showing really how the value of those inclusions shows up financially. You can see, interestingly, if we compare just a one-bedroom apartment, to LIV Munro. At the moment, for the September data where the rent difference purely to the market at the 90th percentile is about 11% and then to the 75th percentile at 17%. And that really -- and it's very quickly, easily able to be seen where the customers do see the value and what the attraction of that -- what that is.\\nOnce we take the fact that they don't need a health and wellness membership, or necessarily a car that white goods are included, that there isn't an outlay for a bond, the numbers become quite compelling quite quickly. And that is before all of the other inclusions that are listed below, which are actually for a lot of people, what really makes the difference and where they see the value.\\nAs I said, we have more than 1,100 customers today. This is -- we also have a lot of pets, more pets than children, which is an interesting trend in and of itself. And again, we are really using and having that one-to-one relationship with those customers to really understand their living preferences, their experience, where we can continue to evolve and improve the offer. And testament to our incredible team who deliver a really wonderful experience, and it comes through in the customer feedback that we have.\\nWe've made a really strong commitment to delivering right across the whole spectrum of the living experience and a big important part of that is actually digitizing the experience. So our residents don't have keys. Everything is electronic, they had -- can do much of what they need with our purpose-built Mirvac app, whether that be to collect a parcel, to book a space, to have a request for repair or maintenance that can be done on site, to attend an event and to get to know their neighbors or simply building information, which interestingly was built through AI technology, which has enabled us to -- for there to be an on-demand concierge for our residents through the app at any point in time, which we get wonderful feedback on as well.\\nAnd then the insights that this information is really giving us in terms of understanding then how many bookings are being made? How those customers are using those spaces? What is popular in each of the different projects?\\nAnd why how attendance and events might lead to retention rates? And then also areas like booking -- car bookings, where you're able to -- our residents are able to have on-demand access to their own red car share services as well, which has had incredible take-up and is already delivering ancillary revenue for us. I'd just like to end on, I think, some of the really important learnings that we've had over this period of time and really how we try to implement those in real time and those are coming through into the development projects and benefit of that cycle.\\nThe first is really around partnerships. So while Mirvac has an end-to-end capability right across the board, we are certainly about -- also about making sure that where appropriate, we work in partnership with others who are subject matter experts. As I said at LIV Munro, we have 2 resident only Tesla EV -- Tesla vehicles in the basement. And those -- they have had incredible take-up. They have been used every single day since we implemented them. And we -- and the latent demand is significantly more than we expected, and it really again for the car saving amount that someone has, they could have a -- they could use that car for 30 hours a week under the subscription model. So it's really easy to see how it starts to create value for the customers.\\nMaybe other important part is really considering that life cycle assessment right through the project and really what are the operating expenses at the other side of that development phase. All that is every single decision that we make in the development phase has an impact through the operating period and making sure that we're considering the whole life cycle assessment of that. And we know that, that will be important in terms of the resiliency of the returns and that CapEx profile that Richard spoke to earlier.\\nAnd while we've really digitized the living experience for our customers, by and large, can tell you that the value that the on-site team brings and how important they are to driving customer satisfaction is so paramount and you'll meet some of the wonderful LIV Munro team there today, and you might even run into Jackie, who is one of our residents, who interestingly enough, moved out of the retirement village to live at LIV Munro. \\nAnd then finally, I think it's important to understand our approach to amenity space is really about creating and improving the everyday experience of people. It's not about creating brand spaces and having what we've referred to as an amenity arms race, it is about making sure that those spaces have maximum utilization that they're very well designed, that they're tech enabled.\\nOur dining room can be a meeting room by day at a dining room by night. The studio has -- is used for a myriad of different reasons and purposes and, therefore, improving the accessibility for our customers. And having that utilization, we know is really a key part of resident retention. Thank you.\\nThanks, Ang. Good morning, everyone. As you are aware, our funds management offering has expanded considerably in recent years and is now an important part of our overall group strategy. We recently reorganized our corporate structure to ensure that we have market-leading corporate governance and has been well received by both our existing and our potential capital partners. Our focus is on leveraging our in-house asset creation and asset curation capabilities to form aligned partnerships with growth-minded capital in areas where we have deep operational capability and high conviction.\\nWe added 3 new aligned partnerships over FY '23, including our BTR venture and grew our third-party capital under management by $7 billion to $17 billion. As Ang touched on, we are proud to have launched one of Australia's first operational build-to-rent ventures with key cornerstone investors, including Clean Energy Finance Corporation.\\nThe venture comprises Mirvac's operational build-to-rent assets, including LIV Indigo in Sydney and LIV Munro here in Melbourne as well as 3 pipeline assets with around 2,200 lots in our secured pipeline with an expected end value of $1.8 billion. Mirvac owns 44% of the venture with the other 56% owned by outlined long-term capital partners.\\nOur new BTR venture allows us to accelerate our growth ambitions in this sector with aligned capital partners who will partner with us in the funding and delivery of our secured development pipeline as well as in the purchase of future development sites. This partnership frees up capital from the Mirvac balance sheet and allows us to get to scale faster. The BTR venture is serviced by our operating company under the brand LIV which will manage the investments and the assets while Mirvac will provide development and construction services on behalf of the venture.\\nMirvac has retained 100% ownership of the LIV operating platform. The platform has been created with future scale in mind and spans property management, leasing, customer and brand, technology and finance. The platform has been created over our 6-year build-to-rent journey and the operational expertise and learnings across this capability is a considerable point of difference in what remains an immature asset class in Australia.\\nIn a BTR context, our LIV platform typifies what we would describe as deep operational capability that sets Mirvac apart. As the face of LIV for our customers, this platform is a critical component in the quality of our residence experience. The feedback loop from the platform contributes to the evolution of our offering and is highly scalable, providing opportunities for consolidation in what is a highly fragmented sector of subscale players.\\nMirvac generates numerous fee streams for this platform, including property management and investment management, while our broader development capability also generates development management and construction service revenues. As this platform scales up over time, it has the potential to generate meaningful earnings contribution to the group and to generate value creation for our shareholders.\\nWe see considerable scope for growth in our funds platform over time with the opportunity to further grow initiatives across the living sector spectrum. Our deep operational capability, leadership across the sectors we choose to operate in, our ability to create and own our own product, along with our strong focus on alignment and corporate governance are all important points of difference, which will continue to attract like-minded and aligned capital partners to the platform.\\nGoing forward, we'll continue to expand our funds management offering, via our existing vehicles and also across a broader suite of asset classes and product types. We'll continue to utilize the depth of our asset creation and asset curation capabilities. This will allow us to deliver higher returns for investors and accelerate value and capital being unlocked from our deep development pipeline.\\nPleasingly, in the leaving sectors, we are seeing strong tailwinds and forming in the medium term. With an acutely undersupplied market, strong migration trends and tight vacancy, we are confident that we have the pipeline, the brand and the track record to take advantage of these opportunities in the coming years. I'll now hand over to Stuart Penklis to outline the development opportunity in BTR.\\nThank you, Scotty, and good morning, all. As you know, the development skill set at Mirvac is key. With over 50 years of experience, that skill set is more important today than it has ever been. Our deep integrated development platform is a key competitive advantage and a major driver of considerable value to shareholders across commercial, mixed-use and residential creating new, modern, sustainable investment assets delivering development earnings to our shareholders.\\nWe are renowned for our quality, independently recently reflected in our 5-star iCIRT rating, the first 5-star rating to be awarded in Australia. The diversity of our platform provides resilience of earnings through the cycles in our recent consolidation of the Development division into one United team, as mentioned earlier by Campbell, drives efficient capital allocation ensures we are fully leveraging our skills across the platform and provides unparalleled opportunities for our people at Mirvac.\\nWe have an innovation focus reflected in our push into prefabrication and digitization, which is driving efficiency and safety benefits. And you'll be able to see this firsthand on the tour, particularly at LIV Aston. We are taking a more selective approach to development in the current environment, placing $1.8 billion of office developments on hold.\\nThis integrated model has created over $1.3 billion of value over the last 10 years in commercial and mixed-use alone, created over $6 billion of assets for our balance sheet and capital partners, including our 2 operational BTR assets. This is part of the reason we have one of the most modern, sustainable and high-performing investment portfolios in the market. This deep experience and capability and alignment of interest drives benefits across site selection, design, procurement, managing construction and planning risk. It also helps us to deliver positive sustainability outcomes and maintain high-quality standards for our customers.\\nOur success in pioneering the BTR asset class in Australia has been underpinned by our prior learnings across residential and commercial projects and leveraging skill sets across the wider team. I'll now pass on to Sarsha, who will -- who is our Head of BTR development to provide some further color on our BTR development pipeline. Thanks, Sarsha.\\nThanks, Stuart. We've now been developing build-to-rent assets for almost 7 years. And having created 2 of the first assets in the country, there have been considerable learnings we've been able to benefit from. With access to constant feedback loop from our customers and data sets from 2 distinct assets, we can implement changes we believe are necessary in current and future design, all of which is possible with our in-house design and construction teams. This has been demonstrated in our lobby design at LIV Munro, which we carefully considered taking on learnings from Indigo, we worked through a number of iterations to get the design just right.\\nThe lobbies open plan with a casual concierge desk which allows the interaction between the community team and residents, creating a comfortable land-like environment where the residents can congregate. The design provides the perfect environment for incidental interactions as residents come and go from their apartment. And we have had many successful events in the space already.\\nAlso, we found that co-working is one of the most utilized amenity spaces at Munro, which is already a big step up from Indigo. We are now further enhancing our assets under development by adding additional meeting rooms and desks to cater to the demand. Lastly, modular construction creates valuable savings in cost, time and waste and ensures a very high-quality finish.\\nOur bathrooms are created in an off-site factory under controlled conditions with all of the tiling, plumbing, fittings and fixtures installed. Then the pod are craned in reducing the need for numerous subcontractors during that busy finishing phase where there's a lot of wet trades typically. Our design team continued to evolve the layouts of the pods, and we can use our scale to forward order these pods across our entire residential development book of projects delivering considerable savings.\\nDeveloping with ESG is the heart of everything we do and has truly become more important to the industry, partners and residents. Our socially aware residents expect more than just token sustainability measures and are making decisions based on their values. LIV Munro has a strong sustainability focus, targeting an 8.1 NatHERS rating.\\nFrom sustainability by design in how we activate our spaces and provide communities where people can age in place. Sustainability and the positive choices we empower our residents to make every day.\\nAcross our build-to-rent portfolio, we're eliminating gas, installing solar panels and buying 100% renewable power through embedded networks as well as targeting Green Star points that improve air quality, access to daylight and thermal performance, all of which optimize the consumers living experience while reducing energy use.\\nWe're installing EV chargers for car [ sharing ] and upgrading our substations to cater for the future transition to electric vehicles and providing one-for-one bike parking and access to scooters to encourage alternate modes of transport. \\nLooking now at our current development pipeline under construction. This is our project, LIV Aston, which we'll all take you on a tour today as the previous speakers have advised. LIV Aston is located on the corner of Spencer and Flinders Street in the Melbourne CBD and will set a new benchmark for build-to-rent development in Victoria and will cater to customers that are seeking a frictionless lifestyle. \\nThis project has just topped out, as [ Angela ] mentioned, which was very exciting, and is due for completion mid-2024. It will include 474 apartments, 20 of which will be provided as affordable units, which the LIV Team will manage. There will be 670 square meters of ground [ floor ] retail, which is focused on food and beverage and services, and service uses aimed to complement the residential offering. \\nThe [ whole ] of Level 5, over 2,000 square meters, is dedicated to resident amenity, with a focus on health and wellness, and includes co-working, cinema, pool, gym, saunas and a pet park, of course. There are also communal areas for people to entertain friends and family with our Level 32 private dining offering spectacular views down the [ Yarra ] River, which we will have the benefit of showing you on the tour.\\nLIV Anura is our first project in [ Newstead ], Brisbane and includes 396 apartments and 1,200 square meters of retail. The project is part of the pilot program with the Queensland government to deliver high-quality tenure-blind housing for key workers. 25% or 99 apartments will be offered to people with locational needs, who work in professions such as health care, emergency services or education, and satisfy the state's eligibility. \\nThe apartments will be leased, managed and operated by the LIV Team and spread throughout the building to ensure diversity. The key workers will have full access to all the building amenity, which includes pool, sauna, co-working, pet park and resident lounges. LIV Anura is currently under construction and is due for completion mid-next year. \\nAnd finally, LIV Albert Fields. LIV Albert Fields is 6 kilometers to the north of the Melbourne CBD in Brunswick, which has a really strong art in live music scene while being highly connected and multicultural. Albert Field is a mid-rise project of 498 apartments on a 1 hectare site, surrounded by 20 hectares of park land.\\nThe project will include 15 affordable housing units and retail activating the ground plane. The amenity at Albert Fields is curated to target our target customer, the progressive humanist, who lean into sustainability and seek out suburbs led by community feel. There is over 2,600 square meters of internal and external amenity, including gym, co-working, a workshop and a communal laundry, which is a bit different from our other assets, rooftop dining and kitchen gardens. \\nLIV Albert Field will be 100% fossil fuel free and is our first project targeting 5 stars under the new Green Star buildings tool. We started construction earlier this year, and we are targeting completion mid-2025. I will now pass across to Stephen Gould, our GM of Land Lease, sorry, to walk you through the land lease sector. Thank you.\\nThanks very much, Sarsha. And good morning, everyone. It's a real pleasure to be here with you today and also online. So my name is Stephen Gould. I've been given the exciting opportunity to lead Mirvac's launch into the land lease sector. I've been at Mirvac now for just under 18 years, and I'm really looking forward to seeing Mirvac write the next chapter and really push hard into the living sectors. \\nSo over the past 12 months, we've been advancing towards establishing our land lease platform with a focus on land that we control or we own within our residential MPC business. So today, I'll provide an update on the progress that we've made as well as providing a high-level overview of the land lease model and why it's so attractive to Mirvac. \\nSo first, on the land lease model, and this might be known to some of you already through investments in other platforms, but at a high level, land lease involves the creation of purpose-built communities for downsizes, who want to live in an inclusive and safe community alongside other like-minded people, and they're designed to promote a physical and mentally active lifestyle.\\nAs the developer of a land lease community, Mirvac retains ownership of the land and the community facilities while the customers enter into long-term lease agreements for specific areas within the community, upon which their home is located. The customer buys the home from Mirvac, which releases a development profit to Mirvac, and the customer then pays a weekly rent for the land that the house is situated on. \\nEach resident in land lease community is responsible for the maintenance of their own home and ensuring that externally, it continues to meet the standards that are set by the developer. And the developer's obligation is to ensure the community facilities are maintained to a high standard and includes, which includes the upkeep of the common area landscaping.\\nSo under the long-term rental agreements, which are commonly referred to the site agreements, the rents are escalated annually generally in line or slightly above CPI. When residents exit a land lease community, there's no -- generally, there's no deferred management fees or exit fees, although some operators do have these arrangements. But where they don't, what it means is the customer retains all capital gains. And this is a key difference between our retirement villages and land lease. \\nWhen customers enter a land lease community, they buy the house, there's no stamp duty payable because the purchase of the house is considered a [ chattel ], and there's no stamp duty, given that the relocatable nature of the homes.\\nFor customers who are eligible to receive the Commonwealth Rental Assistance, which is normally a high percentage of land lease customers, a portion of their weekly rent is funded by the Australian government. \\nOne of the pathways to qualify for Commonwealth Rental Assistance is being eligible to receive the age pension. And this requires satisfaction of two tests, an asset test and an income test. The income test is generally satisfied because these customers are generally retired persons or retired couples. \\nOn the asset test, however, in the case of a couple, they need to have financial assets, financial assets and things like cash, shares, superannuation, valued at less than $986,500, so it's quite a lot. And if they've got less than that, they qualify for an age pension or part pension. And importantly, the value of the home that they're buying is excluded from that asset test. \\nSo Commonwealth Rental Assistance for a couple is $74 a week and $78.50 for a single person. So assuming a $200 per week rent under a land lease site agreement, almost 40% of the rent is funded by the Commonwealth Government. So that, from an investment perspective, that's quite appealing to us. \\nSo the combination of low-risk, secured, passive recurring income with embedded, contracted rental growth, together with development profits and the recycling of capital through the sale of homes provides the basis of a real compelling investment proposition.\\nCoupled with the strong tailwinds driven by our aging population, low penetration rate within an emerging sector, the government support of qualifying customers through the Commonwealth Rental Assistance, virtually no vacancy, no downtime and limited arrears risks and low CapEx and incentives, we think land lease provides our security holders with a really favorable risk-adjusted investment return profile. \\nWe think the size of the market opportunity in the land lease sector is significant, with the population older than 55 years of age expected to almost double over the next 40 years. So penetration within the sector is relatively low compared to the retirement villages sector and the manufactured housing market in the U.S.\\nSo as awareness of the land lease sector in Australia grows and as the quality of the offering improves, growth in the land lease sector will accelerate, driven by the combination of the large population of over 55, together with the expansion of the market share. The land lease sector is rapidly evolving away from its cottage industry past and becoming a meaningful institutional asset class.\\nAs well as being a highly compelling investment proposition, land lease also provides a compelling customer proposition through lifestyle, financial and social benefits in an environment which is supported by the Commonwealth Government and aligned with government policy. \\nCustomers are able to downsize from their family homes and use the equity that's released to purchase a modern land lease home in communities which have resort-like facilities. Homes within land lease communities are purposefully designed to offer low-maintenance living, which for many downsizes, is a key attraction with no lawns to mow and gutters to clean.\\nA key aspect of the customer value proposition in land lease is the social connection on offer. Customers trade off or trade away the need for large backyards and are instead provided access to community facilities, which open up opportunities to interact with their neighbors in a way that would have been difficult in the family home. \\nThe community facilities are generally extensive and can include swimming pools, spas, gyms, saunas, industrial kitchens to cater for large gatherings, tennis and pickleball courts, lawn bowling greens, cinema rooms, dining rooms, games room, craft and hobby rooms, golf simulators, communal gardens. And we're even seeing our bowling alleys being incorporated into these communities. \\nThere are many ways that residents can choose to remain connected to others in a land lease community and to make new friends, whether through informal bumpings or participating in organized events or activities, which are normally curated by the resident-formed social clubs within the community. And many land lease communities offer on-site storage for caravans as many downsizes will lock up and leave for extended periods. And having a low-maintenance home makes this easily achievable. \\nAnd for older people, physical security becomes more important and particularly so for single people. The safety offered within a land lease community through perimeter fences, vehicle access controls and CCTV coverage enhances the customer proposition further. And I've already mentioned the financial benefits through no stamp duty and the access to the Commonwealth Rental Assistance.\\nLand lease homes are generally very affordable and normally sold at a lower price to the surrounding market, adding to the financial benefits that the customer receives. On the housing supply side, when downsizes move from their family home and into a land lease home, they're freeing up a home for first home buyers and upgraders to help solve Australia's housing shortage. \\nMirvac has many of the building blocks internally to establish a presence in the land lease sector, including being an existing land owner. Mirvac has over 50 years experience in the residential development sector with a strong brand and thousands of existing customer connections, all of which will assist in establishing our presence in the sector. \\nPrefabrication of entire homes or elements of homes offers future benefits within the sector, and Mirvac has experience in prefabrication within our Residential business. And that knowledge is transferable to Land Lease.\\nOur first Land Lease project will be located within our Everleigh MPC project in Brisbane. And the [ Greenbank ] site of just over 11 hectares has been identified, and planning works are underway to bring this site to life, which will initially require a change-of-use application being submitted to the approving authority later this year. \\nEverleigh sits within the Logan LGA and will benefit from a large potential customer base of downsizes in the surrounding region. Significant amenity is already being invested by Mirvac into our Everleigh master-planned community project, including sports fields, a wetland park and a future town center. \\nFuture residents of our land lease community at Everleigh will have access to all of this amenity in addition to the facilities that will be delivered within the community for the benefit of those land lease customers or residents only. \\nThe site that we've identified for land lease at Everleigh will provide customers with a sense of privacy but also remaining connected to the broader master-planned community with fantastic visual connection into the adjoining future wetland park and conservation forest area. \\nAs land leases targeting downsizes, there's minimal cannibalization of residential demand by our land lease project, given residential master-planned community projects typically target first home buyers and upgraders. So land lease is complementary through this incremental demand that it generates. We're excited about bringing this project to life and creating a very attractive community for our future residents at Everleigh. \\nAside from this first project, we're also looking at unlocking additional land lease opportunities within our MPC portfolio, and we hope to talk about those at a later time. So we look forward to the growth of our exposure in this really attractive asset class over time. And we'll now open to questions from the room and via the webcast. I'll be joined by Courtenay, Richard, Stuart and Angela. So thank you.\\nGreat. So we'll just move to the Q&A session now. I will take questions from the room. And obviously, those on the webcast, please send them through, and I'll ask the questions out as well. Thank you.\\nAre you able to talk about what percentage of your capital you see allocated to the entire living sectors over time. And also, whether there would be any additional capital partnering opportunities in Land Lease?\\nSo maybe I'll start with that one. So our plan, I think, as we've spoken about it in April and again at the full-year results, is to grow our allocation. We haven't set a target yet. The natural growth you will see just through the development pipeline we've got in BTR. So that's roughly 3% now. By the time we get to 2,200, that's sort of getting close to 5%, and then we have an aspiration of growing to 5,000. So that will start to give you a sense of where the allocation is going to.\\nLand Lease, we certainly have high expectations of growth. And to many in the room we've mentioned in the past, we will look organically and also inorganically if opportunities exist to help us. And we're largely do that by funding over time via the disposal of some of the older office assets with an aim to maintain our office portfolio with a real focus only on the premium-grade stock, which is roughly 50% of the portfolio at the moment.\\nAnd more capital partnering?\\nCapital partnering, I think you should -- we're a big believer in capital partnering across the board. It's -- we think it frees up our balance sheet, gives us a lot of flexibility, and it gets aligned capital to work alongside us. So yes, potentially.\\nJust a question for -- on land lease. You've got one project in Everleigh, it's obviously early days. Do you expect to activate that across all the land bank of your mass [indiscernible], going forward, and -- similar to one of your peers bring in a capital partner to accelerate that? And on that same thing, would you look at a platform to accelerate that entry into the market because it takes time to get scale? So a few questions there, but all land lease focused.\\nMaybe I'll address the, I guess, organic pathway here. We are looking at all of the land that we own. Real focus on East Coast. There are some planning constraints in the Sydney Basin, so that's probably going to push us more into the Victorian market. But we're going to start in Queensland, which has traditionally been a pretty strong market from a land lease perspective. And, we think that the Everleigh project is well located and should be quite attractive from a customer perspective.\\nI think the team has identified 6 to 8 sites already across the portfolio that they could develop into, that will happen over time. But as you've heard from [ Gould ] and Gavin today, we like the sector, and we want it to be material for the group. So for it to be material, we'll look at opportunities. \\nBut what you're hearing today is the opportunity on our existing platform, which I think we've got the capabilities to deliver. But getting to scale is interesting for us. So we'll look at those opportunities.\\nSo you would look at external and also capital partnering to accelerate, a fair comment?\\nPotentially.\\nOkay. And then just finally for me, on the build-to-rent stuff is great because you've been a first mover. In commercial, you make a lot of profits, Campbell, in -- historically, to that spread. It looks like build-to-rent, there's not a lot of development profit, more fee and income base and more total return driven as opposed to the upfront development. Is that a way to look at it?\\nI think that's probably a fair assessment. I think when we look across the developing activities in Mirvac, build-to-rent probably is at the lower end of development return if you're looking at return on its own. But if you look at the quality of the income stream that's created, it's probably one of the better-quality income streams. \\nSo for us, it makes a lot of sense to keep investing from our MPT perspective because it's good, secure long-term income streams with low volatility, which goes to the resilience in income that we are looking for from Mirvac Property Trust. \\nAnd we're looking for capital partners to help us on the developing side because the returns are a little lighter than we have in other areas of the business. However, this is all about growing long-term income streams. And we need a like-minded capital, which we have, to join us in that pursuit.\\nJust following on Lauren's question, how capital light do you see the living sector being or the strategy being when it fully matures?\\nWell, maybe from a capital-light perspective, if you take our full-year results a few months ago, we are spending, on average, $88 million a year in tenant incentives across predominantly office and retail, and we're spending roughly $44 million in maintenance CapEx. \\nAs we allocate more capital to these sectors, we think those numbers will diminish over time, which means that the capital efficiency of our business should get better, which means the cash flows from our business become a little more secure, a little more regular without those heavy CapEx burdens that comes from tenant incentives and maintenance CapEx.\\nAnd if you think about the BTR business, you guys are at 44% of the business. Do you see that being steady for the next few years or over 5, 6 years? Will that be down at 10, 15?\\nLook, we're looking to grow the business, as we've said. So capital, we still need capital to grow out the build-to-rent part of our business. And LIV needs to get to scale. We're obviously on a pathway to 2,200 apartments, with an ambition of 5,000 apartments. It's going to take time. This is a sector that doesn't exist in Australia really yet. And so this is a developed-to-core strategy. It's going to take us time.\\nBut we have like-minded capital that wants to get there with us.\\nThank you. Good morning. Thanks for hosting today, David Pobucky from Macquarie. Just in terms of the timeline around the 5,000 apartments, what are your thoughts around that timeline? And is there enough opportunity in the subsector across all the players, given the structural tailwinds? Or would you expect constraints like more competition for land, et cetera?\\nI think in terms of the pathway to 5,000, we definitely see being able to secure and have that pipeline operationalized by 2030 as an ambition and the one we see being executable as well. I think that the market is in an interesting phase right now, just with respect to the number of -- there's a big difference between the number of genuine participants that have built and developing product as compared to what is early planning or even just approval pipeline.\\nSo I think that the sector is in a stage of maturity, certainly, but there's, as Campbell said, a long way to go, but a quite significant runway and opportunity. And we certainly feel we're really well placed to be able to deliver on that.\\nJust second one for me, if I could, please. You spoke a bit about building scale in land lease. Can you speak to how investors should be thinking about returns for that part of the segment at this early stage?\\nYes. So sort of a yield on cost of between 5% and 5.5% for an established land lease project, rental growth of minimum 3.5% for CPI, whichever is higher. And from a sort of a development perspective, generally targeting a normal development IRR return.\\nLou Pirenc from Jarden. Two questions. One on build-to-rent, can you talk about affordability issue? And how are you going to balance delivering returns for your investors versus the political pressure of \\\"we need more affordability?\\\" And linked to that is, you talked about one project, 25% for essential workers; other projects, 15 units out of 400. How do you determined that? Is that just to get the DA approved? Or is there more thinking behind that?\\nYes. I answered the first question -- the second question first. So certainly, it's a range of different scenarios with respect to the -- what ends up being the total quantum of apartments that might be affordable and also the range of that affordability in terms of addressing, perhaps, a medium to low income earner as well. \\nAnd that really is dependent on the -- some can be planning driven, so it can just be that we will dedicate to provide a certain percentage at -- a certain percentage at a certain discount for a defined period of time. And that, of course, is then considered as part of the overall metrics and return of the project.\\nBut then at the other end of the scale, there is obviously the opportunity to work more in partnership with government. And Anura is a great example of that, where we can provide a more meaningful contribution to a more diverse customer base. \\nSo we see build-to-rent as being really in a great place to be able to deliver probably to what we call the missing middle of people that not -- don't necessarily need income support in any way but do need to be located ideally close to where they work.\\nAnd so I think we think that's really great. And there is a fantastic example of that as a project in the -- 2 kilometers from the CBD, 100 apartments that will -- close 100 apartments that will be delivered for exactly that cohort. And that is really important in terms of creating sustainable and productive cities as well. And -- but it is difficult to do without government partnerships. \\nSo I think the great part about that is, obviously, there's a lot of dialogue in play now. And I think the opportunity to continue to work in partnership, going forward, particularly as we talk about the housing targets, is good, and we are well placed to be able to deliver on that as well.\\nAnd certainly, I think we recognize and Alex's research also really shows that there is a very big addressable audience beyond what our current Gen 1, Gen 2 product type is. And we are really focused on trying to broaden that out. That will come from a range of product typology as well. \\nAnd certainly, that conviction that we have that people are prepared to trade down some private space in order to perhaps have a more affordable solution when you can complement it with a level of amenity not -- doesn't have to be ridiculous amounts of amenity, but just meaningful changes, and so there's an element of product and also location and -- within the developments as well. \\nSo it is something that I think we recognize that we can address a much larger audience. And as we scale, it becomes even easier to be able to do that as well, which we think is important.\\nGreat. And then just as a second question, how should we think about operating costs, particularly with Land Lease kind of a new business? Is that all just part of the broader development residential business? Or should we expect a ramp-up, a step-up in building a team there?\\nYes. Look, from a development perspective, I think the one conscious decision that we made and Campbell alluded to was bringing all of development skill set together. \\nAnd if you look at our platform being able to leverage those skill sets across the entire business, we see as a true competitive advantage moving forward. And that's not just from a development perspective, it's from a procurement perspective, it's from a design perspective, and it's really leveraging, I suppose, that uniqueness of the Mirvac diversity to deliver value.\\nSo we will continue to push. And I think one of the great slides that was up today was just showing that diversification, particularly in living, anything from land subdivision to detached houses, to attached houses, mid-rise apartments, high-rise apartments and sort of everything in between is truly unique and delivers enormous competitive advantage to not only the business, our people, but obviously, our investors as well.\\nSorry, can I just add? From an operating platform point of view, it's very important, obviously, to build-to-rent. We retain that operating platform for the moment. And we think it's important to create value, will create value over time. We've stated before that we don't think really that gets to a breakeven position until it gets beyond our current pipeline. So between 2,500 to 5,000, it will get to a breakeven position. \\nSo we're funding those operating costs for the short term, but we see the value that will get created in the long term. I think Land Lease is early days for us. We've got 1 project. We're not sitting around establishing a massive team that's burning costs. [ Gould ] is doing a great job getting Everleigh off the ground, and that's our focus at the moment.\\nYou have a quick question on the line, just -- I'll pass on in 1 second. Just following on that comment, Courtenay, about the build-to-rent operating platform in terms of the breakeven, you can answer that. Just where the earnings might come through in the P&L for the OpCo?\\nAll of that is in the Funds segment, so in Asset Management. So Tory, Victoria Tavendale is here today. She's responsible for delivering the Property Management, Asset Management platform into the build-to-rent business, and it will all sit within that line in our segment reporting.\\nI was just wondering if you can comment on the lease terms for build-to-rent. So if someone takes a 3-year lease up, for example, do they have fixed escalators in that? And how much would you capitalize on rents that are supposedly 20% up? Like would you put a 20% rental increase on one of your tenants? And lastly, all related to this, how do you manage credit risk and evicting tenants if you have to?\\nYes. Great. All really great questions. So in terms of the -- if you have a multiyear lease with us, then effectively within the lease, there is a mechanism where the rent will be reviewed one of three ways, and it's written that it's the greater odd. So to be the greater of CPI or a fixed percentage, which we have nominated in the leases at 4%. \\nIn Melbourne, for example, it's the RPI, which is a rental price index, and that tracks to the performance of the rental market. So across those mechanisms that then results in what that 12-month review is.\\nAnd of course, that is from a [ rental ] perspective, they have some level of certainty of what that is going to be, albeit there is exposure, obviously, to market conditions, which they would be exposed to otherwise and also then enables that, I guess, part of the investment thesis that we are able to that -- even though you might have a multiyear lease, you're still having that kind of inflation benefit as well. \\nI think with the review process and obviously, just thinking about how we best manage this, it is a case of one, obviously, really trying to optimize cash flow and valuation, but obviously, in a way that we think is really sustainable as well. \\nSo the -- and that is about being really transparent with our customers around what the market performance is and therefore, what the review process is and why and having conviction in the overall offering and the difference that it has relative to a typical rental experience.\\nSo we've seen resident retention rates, more recently, higher than we probably anticipated. And probably, that's a reflection of where the market performance is right now. But ultimately, it is about also being fair and reasonable. And we know that there might be times when churn can be higher, and therefore, we might achieve greater leasing spreads on a new deal. But obviously, achieving that high levels of occupancy are really important as well. So it's a balancing act.\\nWe go through, again, I think, obviously, part of the [ integrated ] model, we go through, effectively, a due diligence process across each and every resident that we -- that applies with us. That means that what we do is an equivalent of a credit check, we're making sure we check rental history, check and [ plum ] history. There's reference checks undertaken as well to try to create that -- to create certainty around that.\\nAnd of course, the last thing we want to do is put someone into a tenancy that can't afford that tenancy as well, that only creates future problems for us. So it's very much an approach of all of that being considered as part of that. And then if a resident is not right, it's better to reject them upfront than to have to deal with it later, and that's certainly our approach.\\n[ Angelo ]. This might sound like a premature question. I'm just thinking sort of 15 or 20 years' time, when we develop an office building, we often look to move it on in that kind of time frame. With this kind of product, you've got a brand to consider as well. I'd just be interested in what thought process you have over that time frame. And I'd sort of put the same to Land Lease, which I appreciate is even more premature, but...\\nI think one of the benefits of being a single asset owner and our approach to, I guess, long-term life cycle maintenance as well, it's unlike an office building where a lot of that capital is actually being dependent on the tenant and when they're coming and going. \\nAnd we obviously forecast what our turnover costs are going to be at a period of time. But also, as we think about repairs, renovations over the cash flow period as well. We're able to do that much more strategically, and that brings back in the benefit of the in-house model in that procurement process as well.\\nAnd I think a much more sustainable way to do that, you don't necessarily have to -- you're not ripping out a fit out every time a tenant's moving on, we're adapting the building over time. \\nAnd certainly, I think when we're designing upfront, it's the same principles. We think about that long-term ownership and really applying that in the development phase, which goes part to why the development returns may not necessarily be as compelling on day 1 because you're actually preserving the returns over time as well, so -- and I think ultimately that better environmental outcomes and ultimately, hopefully, better financial returns as well.\\nI think that we can see when we look to the more mature markets, particularly in the U.S., obviously, that's going through a cycle of kind of uplift in renovation and changes. And I think, obviously, that we're a long, long way away from that, but we have conviction that when we take the long-term view today and make the right decisions today that, that will serve us well for where we go in the future.\\nMaybe I could just follow on, Angela, and ask a bit more. I'm interested in the -- sorry, I've cut off the question, Steve.\\nI'm interested in the expected OpEx of build-to-rent over the long term. Obviously, you've got a lot of leases per square meter. You have a lot of kitchens and bathrooms that you're adding. How do you compare on your expectations, it's obviously early days, the build-for-rent versus other asset classes in terms of an OpEx perspective?\\nYes. I mean I think we think about OpEx and CapEx as 2 very distinct buckets. I think that's really important. And we definitely see a category, we can tell you the operational benefits -- operating expenditure benefits if we think about those three development phase. So that is how -- I know it sounds simple, but how often -- how many times are we going to have to clean the windows? \\nThe facade matters, the windows matter, the way that we -- all the finishes that we use have a direct impact. Where we locate the waste and how easy it is for -- to be moved, all of these considerations, how quick, how will people use the spaces, what efficiency do we get through the towers, through the lifting, through secure -- and how that impacts ongoing security? And my sense is that it's taken us good period of time to really learn that, to hone it and to be able to accurately forecast it, going forward, as well.\\nAnd I think it'll be interesting to see how the market truly adapts to that as the market also learns that as well. In terms of operating expenses for the projects, they really vary. And it's fair to think about it in 3 distinct buckets: One is obviously your statutory costs, which -- and your insurance costs, what we call the controllable expenses, which are really about that cleaning, maintenance, security and then the management costs as well.\\nAnd they will roughly split out to about 1/3 of the total operating expenses. And then that can range between sort of between sort of 20% -- early 20% to even up to 30% of the total revenue that we achieve each and every year. \\nAnd then for CapEx, we again take a life-cycle view, so looking out over that sort of 20-year period and then obviously really accounting for that, obviously, within our [ DCF ] assumptions as well. And Rich talked to that, roughly looking at around 50 basis points as a proportion of [ GAV ] over that long-term period as well. And we are continuing to learn every single day with respect to that.\\nCampbell, can I just get you to clarify your answer to Lauren's question earlier, just about the 50% office? Is that using offices as a funding tool and it will be 50% of group assets, is that what you were saying?\\nYes. Look, I think we've -- I think the way you should read that is that over time, we will be reducing our exposure to office. But we still like office as an asset class, but where we found the best performance in office is in premium grade. That's approaching 50% of our portfolio now, which is one of the highest on the street. \\nThat's an area we want to focus on when it comes to office. And over time, I think you'll see, as you've seen us done pretty much every year over the last 10 years, you'll see us continue to dispose of older real estate to fund the next generation of income-producing assets, whether it be build-to-rent, industrial, office or land lease.\\nSorry. So 50% of your portfolio, office portfolio today is premium?\\nThat's correct.\\nAnd the rest is saleable. Is it?\\nNo, I'm not saying that. I'm saying over time, our focus is to own premium-grade real estate. We've got a lot of really good-quality office buildings, which is not premium grade but in great locations. That doesn't mean that we'll be selling those anytime soon. \\nBut what I'm saying is that the thematic that we're investing to is over time, we will reduce exposure to office and grow our exposure to the living sectors, in industrial. And we will do that via a couple of ways: One is retained earnings, which we retain in our payout ratios, which you've seen over many years. And the second will be reallocating capital away from older office buildings, which you've also seen us do pretty much every year over the last 7 or 8 years.\\nAngela, I think you've had the same 5 BTR owned and sort of completed and development assets to probably 18 months. Just wondering, is that a deliberate strategy to prove up the asset class internally? Or have you kind of just not seen acquisition opportunities to top up that pipeline?\\nI think it's a combination of three factors, really. Certainly, we've got a dedicated new business team who are actively assessing market opportunities and really have been doing so for a period of time. We've certainly been prudent through the last part of the cycle and -- in understanding a lot of those operating metrics that I've spoken to, making sure that we're considering that as part of that process. But we've obviously been very focused over the last 12 months in establishing the venture.\\nThat was a really important step in this growth plan and making sure that we had aligned partners with us who are ready to capitalize on the next stage of the growth plans as well and making sure that when we're standing behind something as we have been that we really -- we have the Mirvac's commitment to doing so as well. \\nSo -- and the last 12 months, particularly have been really important in terms of being able to do that and prove up those operating metrics. So I think we're at a really exciting point now in terms of going forward and the next stage of that growth towards that 5,000 apartments.\\nAnd most of the active developers are seeking capital to fund their pipelines, which you obviously got, but they're not all going to get. So do you think you see yourself as a consolidator of some of those platforms that maybe can't get equity?\\nI think there'll be consolidation in the sector over time. There's, as stated, 28 platforms today, which either have an aspiration or -- to participate in the market. But really, when you look closely, it's probably -- the kind of really active participants are significantly smaller than that. And I think that does probably lend itself to future consolidation opportunities, but we're really focused on the pathway to 5,000 in that organic growth and -- as our sort of primary focus, going forward.\\nWe don't think this to be a pretty big step, going forward, as you saw in the slides. And whether there's organic or inorganic opportunities in build-to-rent, we'll have a look at those, assuming we've got the right capital partners alongside us.\\nSo one more question, sorry. Are you able to give us a trading update on how the Resi business is performing post balance date?\\nCertainly. Look, I would say that it's patchy. I think that to generalize about the market at the moment is challenging because we are seeing some projects that continue to see very good volumes, and then we're seeing other projects that are seeing quite soft dynamics at the moment. I would say that first-home buyers MPC is still continuing to be soft in terms of demand. I think that the sentiment on the ground is that there's still a fear of increased interest rates coming through.\\nThe serviceability test that APRA requires the banks to apply of 300 basis points is really starting to now bite, and I think that what we're seeing is that playing through to volumes. \\nIn saying that we are starting to see some green shoots in greenfield MPC, the one thing that I would say is that we are certainly -- and the team today will see it out of the fabric when we go and visit it, there is certainly a focus on and greater demand in that upgrader market, particularly in the middle ring. \\nAnd we're trying to respond to that as much as we can in two ways: Firstly, the certainty of delivery and the fact that you can come to Mirvac and buy a complete solution, you don't need to buy land and engage a third-party builder. So that's certainly how we're playing to that. \\nThe second part of that is through really focusing on the price points and affordability in that middle ring. And again, today, you'll see at the fabric where we're about to launch our first lightweight prefabricated apartment building, which again, is looking to come in at a price point.\\nAnd then into the apartment space, obviously, we're in the process of launching a number of new projects, which -- we're seeing moderate take-up of the plan. I think the one thing that I would categorize is there's a lack of urgency at the moment in the market. \\nBut on the positive side, there is just such a chronic undersupply of product, which we're seeing. We're seeing sales each week on the projects, but it is certainly at a lower rate than what we've seen in previous cycles. But as we said at results, as soon as we think that -- as soon as there's an indication that rates have hit the top of the rate hike cycle, we expect that demand to come back very quickly.\\nAnd I suppose one of the most prominent things that we're seeing in the market at the moment is in the established market, the strengthening of house prices, which we think will bode well to particularly off the planned sales apartment releases.\\nYes. And probably just on the Sydney projects, we have certainly seen a tick up in sales as we're nearing completion on will it be on Willoughby and [ Waverly ]. [ Waverly ] started to settle, likewise, with the first phase of Willoughby. So finally, we're starting to see those projects bring completed product to the market, and we're seeing now an uptick in sales on that project.\\nLikewise, with Green Square, which -- that project for first completions or the first phase of completions will be in November of this year. We're still seeing actually very high sales rates there. And in fact, we're down to about 15 apartments remaining on that project, so of 320-odd, so very strong velocity on, again, established precincts where people can see and touch existing completed product. \\nAnd just finally, in Brisbane, again, Brisbane is still running very strongly from an apartments perspective. And we're just seeing a number of Tier 2 developers continuing to withdraw from the market, which is basically seeing a number of purchases gravitated to the Tier 1 developers.\\nProbably coming towards the end of our Q&A session. We'll have a more fulsome operational update on the 25th of October with the release of our quarterly. But just Sholto, the last question for you.\\nJust on Campbell's, one on the allocation, you've got a lot of good offers and you've got some not as good premium, but still nice. Would you -- there's a lot of talk in the press about converting office to resi. I know it doesn't always work because of the floor pan location and the zoning. \\nIs that something you'd look at in your portfolio as well because you've got 55 Pitt, which will be premium, so you're still allocating capital premium. But would you look at buying either sites that will never really be good for office anymore making the Resi or in your existing portfolio converting, is that something probably more a 5- to 10-year view? Are you looking at that at the moment?\\nYes. Look, probably not so much at the moment. The balance sheet is pretty full. We've got a lot in front of us with Harbourside and 55 Pitt Street, plus potentially the launch of 7 apartment buildings. So we are certainly got our hands full with balance sheet. Are we looking for opportunities? Always. The resi conversion of office is difficult.\\nFloor plate design is probably the most challenging element of it because you just need to have more window space to floor space than you do for an office building, which is the complete office. So they don't necessarily work. But what if office buildings get cheap enough, you might find those maths work. But I'd say, the math would be pretty difficult to make them work in the short term.\\nWill end the Q&A session here. But [indiscernible], we'll have plenty of time for questions with the management team through the asset tours, and I'll just pass it back to Campbell to our closing remarks.\\nOkay. So thank you all for listening in. For those online, but also for those in the room, we really appreciate you spending some time with us, getting a chance to meet with the executive team and the senior people from Mirvac and obviously excited to show you some of the finished product that we've been working on in the living sectors in -- specifically. So I might -- Gavin, I might hand back to you to just take us through the logistics of the day.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":12}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["tx = tx_multi.copy()"],"metadata":{"id":"K-yR7Jap8fWD","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1760028609161,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Beihan Niu","userId":"05557995590675718675"}}},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","TICKER_COL = \"ticker\"\n","TEXT_COL   = \"full_text\"\n","\n","# sanity checks\n","if not isinstance(tx_multi, pd.DataFrame):\n","    raise ValueError(\"tx_multi must be a pandas DataFrame.\")\n","for col in [TICKER_COL, TEXT_COL, \"event_dt\", \"transcriptid\"]:\n","    if col not in tx_multi.columns:\n","        raise ValueError(f\"'{col}' column missing in tx_multi.\")\n","\n","# derive tickers from the data (no aliasing)\n","tx_multi = tx_multi.copy()\n","tx_multi[TICKER_COL] = tx_multi[TICKER_COL].astype(str).str.upper()\n","TICKERS = sorted(tx_multi[TICKER_COL].dropna().unique().tolist())\n","print(\"TICKERS:\", TICKERS)\n","\n","# filter and clean\n","tx_filt = tx_multi[tx_multi[TICKER_COL].isin(TICKERS)].copy()\n","tx_filt[\"event_dt\"] = pd.to_datetime(tx_filt[\"event_dt\"], errors=\"coerce\")\n","tx_filt = tx_filt.dropna(subset=[\"event_dt\"])\n","\n","# keep consistent columns\n","tx_filt = tx_filt[[\"transcriptid\", \"event_dt\", TICKER_COL, TEXT_COL]].reset_index(drop=True)\n","\n","print(\"tx_filt shape:\", tx_filt.shape)\n","display(tx_filt.head())\n"],"metadata":{"id":"YxJMqs4Bg_27","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":241},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1760028609179,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":19,"user":{"displayName":"Beihan Niu","userId":"05557995590675718675"}},"outputId":"36841010-c51b-4d7f-9895-55ae24281b02"},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["TICKERS: ['GOOGL', 'TSLA']\n","tx_filt shape: (108, 4)\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["   transcriptid            event_dt ticker  \\\n","0     2866339.0 2023-08-02 20:39:31   TSLA   \n","1     2866669.0 2023-08-02 23:26:13  GOOGL   \n","2     2886847.0 2023-08-16 17:31:29   TSLA   \n","3     2886964.0 2023-08-16 22:50:31  GOOGL   \n","4     2899204.0 2023-08-30 14:30:26   TSLA   \n","\n","                                           full_text  \n","0  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing b...  \n","1  Good afternoon.

My name is Sarah, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to PayPal Holdings Earnings Conference Call for the Second Quarter 2023. [Operator Instructions] \\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Senior Vice President and Acting CFO. Please go ahead.\\nThank you, Sarah. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal's earnings conference call for the second quarter of 2023. Joining me today on the call is Dan Schulman, our President and CEO. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast, and both the presentation and call are available on our Investor Relations website.  \\nIn discussing our company's performance, we will refer to some non-GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. We will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include, without limitation, our guidance for the third quarter and full year 2023; our planning assumptions for 2023; our comments related to anticipated foreign exchange rates, operating margin, impact from our sale of loans to KKR and share repurchase activity.  \\nOur actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on our Investor Relations website. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, August 2, 2023. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information.  \\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Dan.\\nThanks, Gabs, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on today's call. I'm proud of the PayPal team as we delivered another solid quarter. Revenues came in above the top end of our guidance, and non-GAAP EPS grew 24% to $1.16, in line with the midpoint of our guide. And we are reiterating our guidance for non-GAAP EPS and operating margin expansion for the full year.  \\nEncouragingly, e-commerce growth appears to have stabilized in the mid-single digits, substantially above our estimates when we entered 2023. Our branded checkout volumes grew roughly in line with the industry in Q2 and accelerated to nearly 6.5% growth in the month of June. And in July, our branded checkout volume growth accelerated again to over 8%, our highest monthly growth rate since the end of the pandemic. We expect branded checkout volumes will strengthen throughout the back half of the year, supported by traction from our key strategic initiatives.  \\nOf course, we still face a fluid global macroeconomic environment. However, it is quite encouraging to see core inflation rates continue to come down. As inflation cools, we would expect to see discretionary spending rise, which we believe will support and possibly accelerate the overall growth of e-commerce spending. And as a market leader in digital payments, any uptick in e-commerce will accelerate our growth.  \\nRevenues in Q2 grew by 8% on a currency-neutral basis to approximately $7.3 billion. It's instructive to note that we are lapping certain items that provided an outsized benefit to us in Q2 and Q3 last year. Consequently, those items pressure our revenue growth rate by approximately 1.25% in each of those quarters this year. Excluding these items, our growth in Q2 would have been between 9% and 10%.  \\nAs we mentioned last quarter, we expect our revenue growth in the second half of the year to be roughly the same as, and given recent trends, maybe a bit better than the first half. We expect Q3 revenues to grow approximately 8% on a currency-neutral basis.  \\nI would highlight that July was a very strong start to the quarter, with currency-neutral revenue growth of 9% and TPV growth accelerating into the low teens. And for the year, we anticipate our revenue growth to be between 9% and 10% on a currency-neutral basis.  \\nWe continue to exercise good discipline in managing operating expenses. For the quarter, non-GAAP, nontransaction-related expenses fell 11% year-over-year. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin was 21.4%, up approximately 230 basis points from a year ago. We expect to increase our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year by at least 100 basis points.  \\nAs we look ahead to the rest of 2023 and into 2024, we expect to drive meaningful productivity improvements. Our initial experiences with AI and continuing advances in our processes, infrastructure and product quality enable us to see a future where we do things better, faster and cheaper. These overall cost savings come even as we significantly invest against our 3 strategic priorities.  \\nWe know exactly what we need to do as we look towards 2024. And as you can see in our results, we are beginning to see the fruits of our labor. We understand that over the medium to long term, we need to deliver growth in our transaction margin dollars to ensure we sustainably grow our earnings. And we are beginning to see clear signs that our initiatives will yield notable traction against that objective over the next several quarters.  \\nAs I mentioned, we expect our top line to accelerate to low double-digit growth by Q4. We expect transaction margin dollars to increase while our operating expenses continue to create significant leverage. That, in connection with our share buybacks, enables us to target low to mid-teens EPS growth for the remainder of 2023, even as we begin to lap the increases we enjoyed on our interest income.  \\nI'd like to now turn to our 3 strategic priorities in which we are investing our resources and energy: branded checkout, our PSC merchant solutions and our digital wallets. As I've mentioned in the past, all 3 of these are critical and interrelated. They are essential for us to increase our share of the e-commerce market as well as accelerate our margin dollar growth.  \\nAs we discussed in our June investor meeting, we are meaningfully accelerating new product innovations into the market, scaling our A/B testing and significantly improving our time to market. We are now consistently delivering against our road map on schedule. This is the result of significant investments in our platform infrastructure and tools and enhanced set of measurements and performance indicators, hiring new talent and early successes using AI in our software development process.  \\nWe continue to ramp our test velocity with more than 300 experiments launched across our product experiences in the first half of the year. Every successful test leads to incremental customer benefits. And the cumulative effect of those changes leads to noticeable improvements in our key metrics, including the gains we are seeing in branded checkout growth.  \\nFor instance, our buy now, pay later traction has meaningfully accelerated with the introduction of preapproved amounts to our consumers. Our work in onboarding and onboarding new experiences has driven new monthly cohorts with higher engagement and lifetime value. In this month, we are expanding the rollout of passkeys in the U.S. and Europe, which will greatly simplify the branded checkout log-in experience and drive improved authorization rates that will further extend our lead over our competitors.  \\nOur goal is to continually close the gap in our log-in and checkout experiences every quarter, and to be equal to or better than any competitor within the next year. We simultaneously aim to drive differentiated wallet experiences across both PayPal and Venmo. We believe that only those companies with unique and scaled data sets will be able to fully utilize the power of AI to drive actionable insights and differentiated value propositions for their customers.  \\nWe are already experimenting internally with an AI-driven PayPal Assistant. We envision that a version of this will be part of our consumer app, and we plan to introduce it later this year.  \\nWe continue to see impressive traction in our PSP business, with our growth rates nearly 30% on a currency-neutral basis. Many of the largest tech companies in the world are now either using our Braintree capabilities or are in deep strategic negotiations with us to do so. We are in the process of rolling out high-margin, value-added services, expanding internationally and making noticeable progress with in-person payments. And we continue to receive exceptional interest in our next-generation checkout solution, which will leverage the scale of our network vault, our deep understanding of our two-sided network and the development of proprietary AI models.  \\nI couldn't be more pleased with the initial rollout of PayPal Complete Payments, our PSP merchant solution for channel partners in the SMB market. We are seeing tremendous interest in the platform with a substantial pipeline of completed sales and a backlog of deals that continues to grow. Importantly, our major channel partners are enthusiastic about its capabilities. We have already implemented PPCP with leading channel partners like Adobe, Lightspeed, Recurly, Shift4, Shopify, Stax Payments, UltraCart, Wix and WooCommerce with more than 25 additional channel partners scheduled to be live by the end of the year. This not only demonstrates the strength of our platform capabilities, but will also enable a meaningful number of SMB merchants to access our latest checkout experiences.  \\nThere is a remarkable sense of energy, excitement and enthusiasm among our leadership teams as we see clear and distinct signs of reinvigorated success in the market. We are now able to take advantage of many of the investments we have made over the past years to deliver a best-in-class experience for our customers, leveraging a modern infrastructure and our scale in the age of AI.  \\nWe have successfully recruited a large number of external talent to complement our internal teams in both AI and machine learning as well as throughout our product, engineering and technology groups in order to build upon our success and maximize our opportunity.  \\nI'd like to end my remarks talking about our CEO succession plan. We are in the very final stages of the process with several outstanding candidates, all of whom are highly qualified and excited to lead PayPal as we go into our next chapter of growth. I'm eager to welcome PayPal's next CEO, to work with them on a seamless onboarding and to support them in the amazing PayPal team as I transition to my role on the Board.  \\nAs you can hopefully tell, we have a lot of energy and confidence that we are on the right path with good momentum. Many of the headwinds we faced are now turning into tailwinds. We are executing with a high degree of excellence. We have a firm handle on our business model and can point to numerous successes already making a real difference in the market, which will only continue to compound over time. PayPal is in an increasingly strong position, and we are poised to deliver for our customers and our shareholders.  \\nThank you. And with that, let me turn the call over to Gabs.\\nThanks, Dan. I'd like to start by thanking the entire PayPal team for their continued commitment to serving our customers and executing our priorities. PayPal delivered another solid quarter in a dynamic environment. We're reporting revenue at the high end of our guidance range and earnings per share consistent with our expectations. Our results are tracking with the guidance we gave for the full year and reflect steady progress against our long-term growth aspirations.  \\nWe continue to invest in our key initiatives, while demonstrating discipline in delivering on our operating expense commitments. In June, we were delighted to share more about our long-term strategic plan and product road maps at our investment community meeting. Importantly, the product launches we discussed are on track, and we continue to gain conviction in our ability to accelerate our branded checkout volumes and drive greater profitability across our PSP services.  \\nDuring the quarter, we were pleased to announce a multiyear agreement to sell both our existing European buy now, pay later receivables as well as future originations to KKR. During my remarks, I will discuss the impact of this externalization on our financial results. We have also included additional details in our investor update presentation.  \\nBefore discussing our outlook for the remainder of the year, I'd like to highlight our second quarter performance. As Dan mentioned, revenue increased 8% on a currency-neutral basis and 7% at spot to $7.3 billion. Transaction revenue grew 5% to $6.6 billion, driven primarily by Braintree and PayPal-branded checkout.  \\nHeadwinds to growth in the quarter included the lapping of $75 million in contractual compensation from merchants last year, which was de minimis this year; $72 million less in hedge gains relative to Q2 last year; and the impact from migrating and consolidating legacy PayPal payment services. Other value-added services revenue grew 37% to $731 million. This performance was predominantly due to increased interest income on customer store balances and, to a lesser extent, revenue growth from consumer credit products.  \\nIn the second quarter, U.S. revenue grew 9% and international revenue increased 5%. On a currency-neutral basis, international revenue increased 7%, accelerating sequentially and year-over-year. Transaction take rate declined 11 basis points to 1.74%. Approximately 2/3 of this decline was driven by a decline in foreign exchange fees, in part driven by lower currency volatility, a decline in gains from foreign currency hedges, which are recorded as international transaction revenue, and the headwind from lapping elevated contractual assessments from merchants last year.  \\nWhile merchant mix continued to pressure our branded checkout take rate, the second quarter was an improvement from Q1. Our total take rate declined 6 basis points to 1.94%, affected by the same factors as transaction take rate. Transaction expense as a rate of TPV came in at 94 basis points, 4 basis points higher than Q2 last year. This increase was primarily driven by growth in Braintree volumes, partially offset by rate benefits in core PayPal and Venmo. Overall, transaction expense dollars grew 16%. \\nTransaction loss at a rate of TPV was 8 basis points for the quarter, a 3.6 basis point improvement versus last year. Transaction loss dollars declined 25%. The decrease this year was primarily due to an atypical merchant insolvency last year, which drove a sizable loss in the second quarter, with no comparable exposure this year. Our ongoing risk mitigation activities and mix of volumes also contributed to this performance.  \\nCredit losses were $112 million or 3 basis points as a rate of TPV. On a dollar basis, credit losses increased 65%. Provisions in the quarter were driven by a build of $146 million, partially offset by a $33 million reserve release from the reclassification of our European buy now, pay later portfolio to held for sale from held for investment.  \\nThe operating income benefit from this release of reserves was entirely offset by the fair value discount on the portfolio classified as held for sale. The increased provisioning resulted from increased expected losses in our PayPal business loans portfolio as well as growth in our U.S. Pay Later portfolio. Like the broader industry, we're seeing a normalization of our credit portfolio to pre-COVID delinquency levels across our consumer and PayPal Working Capital portfolio. \\nThat said, we have seen some deterioration in our business loans portfolio. This portfolio represents less than 15% of our overall net credit receivables. And as we discussed last quarter, we have taken remedial actions to address this performance. We've tightened originations and have already seen improvement in new cohorts. We'll be managing the book with similar rigor as we move through the remainder of the year.  \\nAs a result of designating $1.9 billion in pay later receivables to assets held for sale, we ended Q2 with $5.5 billion in net credit receivables, a 3.5% decline year-over-year and a 26% decline sequentially. The decline in receivables due to held-for-sale accounting also contributed to an increase in our reserve coverage ratio. This ratio increased to 10% from 7.8% in Q1.  \\nIn the aggregate, volume-based expenses increased 13% in Q2 relative to an increase of 30% in the second quarter of 2022. Transaction margin dollars grew 1% to $3.3 billion, and transaction margin was 45.9%. While our transaction margin declined in the quarter, the rate of decline slowed considerably from both Q1 and the second quarter of last year, and we're executing on our strategy to grow transaction margin dollars.  \\nWe're encouraged by the progress we're making against our longer-term initiatives that will support improved transaction margin performance over time. Q2 marked the third quarter in a row that we've delivered meaningful expansion in our operating margin on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Ongoing discipline in managing our cost structure allowed us to more than offset transaction margin compression with operating expense leverage.  \\nOn a non-GAAP basis, nontransaction-related operating expenses declined 11%, with reductions across each of our principal operating expense categories contributing significant leverage. Strong expense performance resulted in 20% growth in non-GAAP operating income to $1.6 billion. This is the highest growth in operating income that we've delivered in more than 2 years.  \\nNon-GAAP operating margin expanded 228 basis points to 21.4%, which was slightly below the guidance we gave for the quarter. This is principally attributable to our credit portfolio, where we earned less revenue than expected and increased loss provisions. For the second quarter, non-GAAP EPS increased 24% to $1.16, which was the midpoint of our guidance range.  \\nWe ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $14.4 billion. The net cash outflows for originations of loans held for sale reduced cash flows from operations by $1.2 billion in the quarter, resulting in free cash flow for the quarter of negative $350 million.  \\nLater this year, when the sale of the European BNPL back book closes, the proceeds will be recognized in cash flows from operations and offset this decline. So while the timing of accounting treatment will affect the quarterly profile of our free cash flow, there is no change to our outlook for the year, and we continue to expect to generate approximately $5 billion in free cash flow.  \\nIn the quarter, we completed $1.5 billion in share repurchases. For the full year, we now expect to allocate approximately $5 billion to our buyback program. Our recently announced credit externalization will help optimize our balance sheet and improve our capital efficiency. Given our desire to return capital to shareholders and the confidence we have in our business, we've taken a more aggressive approach to share repurchases. Since the end of 2021, our diluted share count has declined 6%.  \\nI would now like to discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2023. As Dan shared, based on our results through the first half of the year, we're reaffirming our guidance for the year for non-GAAP operating margin expansion and earnings per share. In the aggregate, for the first and second quarters of 2023, we've delivered revenue growth of approximately 9% on a currency-neutral basis. \\nWe expect revenue growth in the back half of the year to be in line with this performance, if not slightly ahead, given the momentum we're seeing in the business. In addition, we're on track to meet our expense guidance for the year and are committed to delivering at least 100 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement. We also continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $4.95, representing 20% growth from 2022.  \\nWe're reiterating our full year guidance while absorbing incremental pressure from our credit portfolio, given strengthening business performance driven by checkout initiatives and our ongoing realization of productivity gains. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to grow approximately 8% on both a spot and currency-neutral basis to approximately $7.4 billion at current spot rates. In addition, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $1.22 to $1.24, representing growth of approximately 13.5% at the midpoint of the range.  \\nIn summary, we're proud of our solid operating results this quarter. PayPal's unique competitive advantages, including our portfolio of differentiated assets and our global scale and ubiquity continue to drive us forward. We're committed to investing in our core strengths and building PayPal for the future. And we're guided by our relentless focus on creating the best possible experiences for our customers.  \\nOur revenue momentum and customer engagement trends position us well to achieve our growth objectives this year and beyond. Given the uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment, we remain focused on managing the things we can control and allocating capital with discipline to ensure we optimize for long-term value creation and resiliency. \\nAnd with that, Dan and I are happy to take your questions. Sarah, please go ahead.\\n[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.\\nI want to ask a question on e-commerce health. And Dan, I know you talked about it upfront. We're just getting a lot of questions on the e-commerce industry in general. So you mentioned inflation easing should help. I'm curious about other trends like shift from services to goods, like our economists are talking about, which I think would also be a tailwind for you versus the headwind previously. Is this something you're seeing? Or maybe is that changing how you're thinking about the second half versus a quarter ago? It seems like there's some room for upsetting your outlook here given the exit growth rate and what you talked about for July.\\nYes. Thanks, Tien-Tsin. It's great to hear your voice, and thanks for the question. Look, I think the story of the quarter is really the sort of the shape of the results inside the quarter and then the strong exit as we went into July and seeing July results. In our view right now, we are beginning to see an inflection point. We're seeing our results on a slightly different trajectory, for sure. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we're clearly seeing a lot of headwinds begin to shift towards tailwinds. \\nE-commerce is definitely one of those. We see e-commerce growth accelerating. We think it is at least in the mid-single digits right now. That's substantially above what we thought when we entered the year where we thought it might be flat year-over-year. And I would say we've got a slight bias that, that will continue to accelerate. \\nYou've got a range out there from low 0 to high at 10%. We think it's probably right in the middle of that, and we think it is being driven by a shift from travel and services into goods, into fashion, more coming into retail pieces of that. And clearly, as inflation cools, we would expect to see more discretionary spend rebound, and that will help drive e-commerce. So one of the headwinds we faced was e-commerce growth slowing. Now it's accelerating again, and that clearly will be meaningful for us. \\nWe're also seeing improvements, as Gabs mentioned, in cross-border. That's beginning to accelerate again. That's obviously a very meaningful thing for us because, one, our value proposition is perfect for cross-border. Consumers buying from merchants that they don't really know, but they trust PayPal to make sure that, that payment will be protected for them. It's obviously extremely high-margin business for us, and that seems to be accelerating nicely right now. \\nPPCP, which was a really important introduction for us for numerous reasons, could not have a better reception in the market. We've got tremendous momentum there. Braintree continues to go from strength to strength, and we're seeing a lot of our value-added services now start to take hold. I can talk about some of that later in the call if somebody wants to ask about that. \\nAnd obviously, branded checkout is accelerating. That 8%, it's the highest we've seen since the end of the pandemic. And we continue to expect to see that strengthen as we go through the year as many of our initiatives are really taking hold in the last quarter. We've got another 200-plus experiments that are going to happen in Q3. And so that's all adding to momentum. \\nAnd I guess at the end of the day, what that's adding up to when we look at our Net Promoter Score, we're now at a 7-year high in that. And so there's clearly a lot of momentum in the business right now, and we just want to double down on that. So we do obviously feel a lot better today than we did 90 days ago. But I think that's just going to continue when you ask that same question a quarter from now.\\nYour next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.\\nRevenue growth was obviously sound, but we still saw transaction profit dollars a little less pronounced versus revenue. I think it actually may have decreased a bit year-over-year. And so Gabrielle, I know you talked about some one-time grow-overs and hedging differences. And I'm sure the mix between branded, unbranded continues to have an impact given the growth of Braintree. But if you could just help us understand the moving parts in the quarter and the trends in the second half as far as gross profit or transaction profit growth goes, that would be great.\\nYou bet, you bet, Darrin. For the quarter, transaction margin dollars grew 1%, which is essentially in line with Q1. That said, when we look at the underlying performance of our business, we're very encouraged by the stronger results we're seeing. In my prepared remarks, I called out several items that created headwinds to growth in the quarter due to lapping. In addition, we actually had some benefits that we saw in the quarter as well from the release of reserves from held-for-sale reclassification as well as from lapping that large merchant exposure last year. \\nAnd so when we adjust for all these items, both the benefits and the drags, on a more normalized basis, we actually see transaction margin dollars in the quarter growing several points faster than the reported 1%. And what we're really encouraged by is the strengthening profile of the business. We're actually starting to see the benefits of our initiatives. As we get through some of the noise from lapping, we do expect to see improving transaction profit growth. \\nWhen we think about the back half, in Q3, we'll still see some pressure on transaction margin performance. In Q4, we expect to see an improvement. And then over the longer term, our TM profile in the future will certainly be benefited by the acceleration in branded checkout, by e-commerce acceleration, by the improved cross-border trends that Dan referred to, as well as from the value-added services that we're adding on the PSP side.\\nThat's really helpful. So it sounds like some of these initiatives are third, fourth quarter events, but they could move the needle starting them.\\nWe expect to exit the year in a much stronger position from a TM trajectory than where we are right now.\\nYour next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\\nI wanted to follow up on Darrin's question. I know that unbranded seems to be a drag or dilutive to margins right now overall, which is a little bit surprising given just kind of how margin structure tends to be throughout the industry. I know you've talked a little bit in the past about adding incremental services to unbranded that could improve that structural margin component in unbranded. Can you talk a little bit about what that may look like, timing, and if any of those initiatives are -- will play a role in improving the transaction margin that you're looking at for the latter part of this year?\\nYes, I'll take a crack at that, James. Thanks for the question. Our PSP business does continue to go from strength to strength. As we talked about our overall, TPV was nearly 30% in the quarter. And that's despite, as Gabrielle mentioned, deprecating some of our older PSP flows, things coming off of our PayPal Pro. We actually migrated about $5 billion of TPV from our legacy stacks onto PPCP in this past quarter. And so it's a bit of a drag in the quarter, but we're going to be done with that by the end of the year. \\nAnd we continue to win marquee accounts in the business, whether that be booking.com, Meta, Allstate Insurance. These are big accounts that we are winning because winning PSP is a strategic imperative for us. It allows us to have our latest checkout experiences with the largest, most important merchants in the world across PayPal, Venmo and buy now, pay later. We capture 100% of the data flows, which really is feeding our AI engines. It's fueling what will be our next-generation checkout. And most importantly, it's fueling kind of our ability to have best-in-class auth rates in the industry and the lowest loss rates in the industry. \\nIn terms of the higher-margin services that we're going to be putting out there, we are seeing a lot of traction on that right now. For instance, we are moving into in-store. That's always been an area of opportunity for us. We are now fully implemented with 20 marquee merchants in over 1,000 in-store locations, over 2,500 POS systems. We'll continue to do quite well there and push significantly in that. We're making good progress in selling things like payouts, risk-as-a-service, disputes, automation. We're seeing our largest customers begin to adopt that right now, whether it be SHEIN or Meta or TikTok, really, these are some of the bigger clients that we have adopting our value-added services. And I'll just give you one example. \\nWe just started doing orchestration in 6 additional LatAm countries with much higher margins. And where we're doing that orchestration for our largest customers, we're seeing like a 190 basis point auth rate improvement. So you're seeing kind of this win-win as we're doing this. \\nAnd then, of course, PPCP, as it goes down market, is a much higher margin product for us. Yes, I talked about all of the channel partners that have already implemented that or in the middle of implementing. And we've got another 25 more partners by year-end in the U.S., another 15 EU partners by year-end. So we're seeing a tremendous amount of scaling on that. \\nWe've also enabled here in the U.S., 1.2 million SMB merchants to basically do a one-click migration into PPCP. We've already done all the risk assessment for them. They're on the right platforms for us to be able to seamlessly transition them onto that platform. So I think we're going to see a large amount of volume moving into PPCP. \\nThat's obviously higher margin, high value-added services. And Braintree will also help. And those will develop over time. Clearly, every quarter, they will add and some cumulative total will start to feel as we kind of exit the year and certainly as we go into 2024 with that. I hope that helped.\\nYour next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.\\nIn terms of operating margin performance, were there any factors besides credit that had a bigger impact than you expected in Q2? And then, separately, can you just talk about the overall health of the credit business? Give us more color on the steps you're taking to maybe manage it a little bit differently. It sounded like that was the plan.\\nAbsolutely. So for the quarter, we expanded our operating margin by about 228 basis points to 21.4%. This was a slight miss to our guidance of approximately 22%, and it was predominantly driven by increased pressure from PayPal Business Loans. There's no other items that really contributed to that miss. \\nOverall, PayPal Business Loans was about a 90 basis point drag to transaction margin and to operating margin, and this is approximately 2x what we expected at the beginning of the quarter. So it really was a real impact. As it relates to our broader credit business, we're in a really good position. Like the rest of the industry, we're seeing some reversion back to pre-COVID levels of performance. But across our diversified portfolio of consumer and merchant credit, we're seeing relatively stable delinquency and charge-off trends. \\nThe largest growth area for us continues to be our buy now, pay later solutions, where our performance continues to be very strong. Of course, going forward, given our partnership with KKR, the majority of the originations are going to be funded off-balance sheet for us, and we'll be able to support the sustained growth of that business. \\nOn the PayPal Business Loan side, this is really the part of our portfolio where we have seen deterioration. This portfolio represents less than 15% of our overall net receivables. We've historically seen consistently strong performance in this book. And last year, we widened the credit box, and the performance has not been within our expected risk appetite. We've taken steps to improve performance. We significantly tightened originations. \\nToday, the book is down about 30% in total receivables. And we expect this pressure to continue through the back half of the year, but then really to abate as we move into next year. That said, the overall strength of our business and the momentum we're seeing is allowing us to maintain our operating margin and EPS guidance for the year while we're absorbing this credit pressure.\\nYour next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\\nI wanted to come back to branded TPV growth. So you had 6.5% in the month of June. You were over 8% in July. You're expecting further acceleration during the balance of the year. So can you just talk more specifically about the drivers of and the visibility on that ongoing improvement? Like how much of it is better macro? How much is traction with PayPal's own branded checkout initiatives? And which among those branded checkout initiatives is moving the needle most materially here in 2023?\\nYes. I'll take a crack at that, Jason. Thanks for the question. It's an important one. We are really pleased, obviously, to see branded checkout accelerate like it is. And we have good confidence that the initiatives that we're putting into place are going to continue to drive that growth. As I think about what is driving that growth, it's hard to delineate exactly what is happening because of macro, in terms of e-commerce improving, in general, as I mentioned to Tien-Tsin's first question around e-commerce and what is due to our initiatives, but we are clearly putting a lot of time, effort and resource into improving the checkout experience. And my hats off to that entire checkout team for all that they've done here. \\nI say, look, first of all, as e-commerce is growing, we're going to grow with it because we are clearly one of the market leaders, if not the market leader in digital payments around that. We do have a scale advantage over anybody in terms of 30 million-plus merchants that we have out there, 80% of the top 1,500 Internet retailers. We have a performance advantage in checkout, up to 600 basis points better in auth rates than the industry average. \\nAnd we have a trust advantage. When small businesses put PayPal on their site, they see their online sales go up by almost 44%. So those are things that we are building upon. But as we mentioned in our Investor Day on June 8, we've -- the amount of acceleration and the amount of innovation we're putting into the market has improved dramatically. \\nWe did 100 A/B tests in the first quarter. We did 200 A/B tests, an incremental 200, in the second quarter. We're going to do another 200 coming here in the third quarter. And in general, about 30% or so of those A/B tests that we run actually create positive benefit coming out of them. What that means is we're going to have like 150 or so improvements in checkout in our digital wallets running through our metrics as we go through. And some of those are 1 or 2 basis points difference. Some of those can increase TPA by 10 or 15 basis points. And when you put all of those together, it's extraordinarily powerful. We are definitely seeing that in our results. \\nWe also are beginning to see a lot of our merchants move to our latest integrations. We know that when we're native in app on the mobile that we hold or gain share. We talked like a quarter or 2 ago, about 33 of our top 100 merchants had our latest checkout integrations, and we had an aspiration to be at 50 by the end of the year. I'm pleased to report that now 43 of our top 100 merchants are in our latest checkout integration. \\nSo we're making really good progress around that. We're not about doing just like the basics. We are improving availability. Latency has now improved by 45% year-over-year. Every couple of milliseconds increases conversion rates on that. And passwordless is really important for us and the rollout of passkeys, some other authentication methodologies that we're using. Now ex the EU, which has SCA, Strong Customer Authentication, we're at about 70% of our checkouts that are passwordless. That's going to continue to go up as we push passkeys, and we're now taking passkeys into the EU, which will be very beneficial because you can actually take out the friction of SCA in those conversions as well. And so we're going to push that really hard. \\nAnd then you see all the other big initiatives that we're doing: the pre-introduction, preapproved amounts for buying BNPL. By the way, in the U.S., we've rolled that out to 60 million of our customers. We are seeing 25% to 30% increase in first-time users of buy now, pay later. And those are using it 5% to 10% more in terms of the overall TPV than those that didn't have the preapproved amounts. And we're going to roll out another 50 million preapproved into the EU beginning of this quarter. \\nWe're taking our rewards up, our rewards and cash back. We saw a 20% increase in the number of people using it from Q1 to Q2. We're now up over 10 million people using our rewards. When they use our rewards, their TPA goes up by 32%. So these are some of the things that we're doing that are making a big difference. We've got a lot of things planned for Q3, and we're beginning to see it in the results and hope to be able to continue to point that out and continue to highlight what we hope to be increased growth in branded checkout.\\nYour next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI.\\nCan you provide an update on your cost takeout plan for 2023, the progress you've made? And do you have any preliminary thoughts quantifying how OpEx reductions will carry into 2024?\\nYes. Thanks, David. I'll start and then probably Gabs will jump in on this. Look, we're going to continue to do surgical discipline in our cost structure. It was down 11% in Q2. For the full year, we still expect that to decline, consistent with what we talked about, by 10%. And therefore, when we think about our operating margin expansion coming up by at least 100 basis points and some of that incremental pressure that we're absorbing on the credit side that, as Gabs mentioned, will kind of move through our numbers by the end of the year, you're obviously seeing growing margin expansion driven by some of the top line enhancements we're doing, not just the cost discipline that we've demonstrated. \\nI would just say that this is not just about efficiencies, but this is about doing things faster and accelerating the velocity of our innovation. It's not about trade-offs. It's about lower cost, but higher performance. And you're seeing that because, look at our MBS being at 7-year highs, look at the amount of innovation that we're now pumping through the system right now. We're getting more done more efficiently. \\nThere's no question that AI is going to impact every single company and every function just as it will inside of PayPal. And we've been experimenting with a couple of hundred of our developers using tools from both Google, Microsoft as well as Amazon. And we are seeing 20% to 40% increases in engineering productivity. Just imagine that in terms of how much more product we can get into the market and how efficiently we can do that. \\nI think we've always known and anticipated that AI will drive productivity improvements really for foreseeable future. But I think the exciting, more unexpected result is that we think it's going to transform our value proposition as well. Things like enabling us to look into all of our transactions, look at early fraud metrics to be able to feed that back to customers with early fraud alerts that assure them that we are protecting them, enabling them to add more and more financial instruments to us as well that we can protect this PayPal assistant that's going to -- that's really an AI chatbot. We've been using it internally inside our consumer app. It's pretty amazing what it can do. Obviously, our advanced checkout, things that customize rewards. So AI is going to be a thing that not only drives productivity improvements for us, but really importantly, value proposition improvements for us. And so we're surgical on our cost thing. We've been very disciplined in it. We're quite pleased with it, and I think we'll see productivity improvements over the years to come.\\nYes. As Dan said, we're on track for a 10% decline in our other OpEx for the year. The first half is down kind of low double digits, call it, 11.5%, 12%. In the back half of the year, of course, we begin to lap some of the cost savings that we began to take out last year. And so the decline in other OpEx declined a bit, and so we'll be in sort of the high single digits then. \\nBuilding on what Dan said, just around delivering better experiences to our customers and the productivity gains, it's also coming from the platform migration and consolidation work that we're doing. And that, too, allows us to scale more efficiently over time. And so you should expect to see us continue to look for ways to deliver better experiences to our customers and scale them efficiently on our platform.\\nYour next question comes from the line -- sorry, we have time for one last question, and it comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.\\nI wanted to ask about the consumer value prop, and a big piece of that is going to be the wallet and the enhancements of the wallet, including offers. Can you just talk about some of the initiatives you're doing there that's going to improve the digital wallet going forward?\\nYes, sure. Thanks for the question. I mean, obviously, increasing the number of consumers who use our digital wallet, it's one of our most important initiatives because we feel it's going to drive both engagement, ARPA, monthly active users. The app user today, the typical app user has a 35% greater ARPU, 60% greater TPV and 25% less churn. And so the more we can put on that, the better. And about 55% of our base today uses the app, just to give you an idea of that. \\nAnd the app, to your point, is designed to enable the full shopping experience, from discovery, which is like the deals and offers that you just mentioned; to flexible payments; the widest array of funding choices, things like buy now, pay later, split tender that enables you to utilize 2 different funding sources to buy your purchase; to a post purchase, which includes package tracking and returns management, refunds directly into your PayPal wallet. \\nI won't go in again to all the experimentation we're doing, but you can see kind of the tremendous amount of velocity there. The new features that are coming into the wallet include this early fraud alert. We've scaled that now to 10%. That's really designed to protect our customers. We can see fraudulent signals well before others. We can let a consumer know that their card has been compromised. We can simultaneous let the FI know so that card can be reissued instantaneously. And so we're seeing early but really positive response to consumers from this, and it causes them, these alerts that come, it causes them to open the app. The more they open the app, the more they do with us. \\nI think I mentioned on the rewards cash back, that will be something that we'll be putting some resource into because we're seeing a tremendous interest in it. These users are up 20% quarter-over-quarter. And the TPA is gigantic improvement, as I mentioned, about a 32% improvement on that. Package tracking, we're now 100% ramped across iOS and Android. It scrapes basically your Gmail account to look for any of your e-commerce orders. They don't even have to be through PayPal. We consolidate them all into one place into our PayPal app. We're seeing a 20% app engagement uplift for those who sign up for that, a 10% improvement in TPA. \\nThings like savings, that's now at a 4.3% interest rate. When somebody does that, their ARPA goes up $26. And their log-in to the app goes up 16x those who don't have a savings account with us. \\nI mentioned buy now, pay later preapproval, that's 50 million more to come this quarter in the EU. And we'll start things like our advanced AI checkout with our first clients later this year and our PayPal Assistant using AI technology as well. Those are just some of the things to come. There's a lot of innovation. And as I mentioned, my hats off to the team because I think they're just doing a great job hitting their schedule, doing constant experimentation and really making our experiences much improved and moving towards best-in-class. \\nSo thanks, everyone, for your great questions. I really appreciate it. I want to thank everybody for your time, and we look forward to speaking to all of you later. So take care. Thank you.\\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.\",\n          \"Good day, everyone, and welcome to the full year presentation of BSA Limited. I'm Arno Becker, the CFO and Joint CEO. And I'm joined by -- with Richard Bartley, COO and Joint CEO. Together, we will be taking you through the full year results. \\nBefore we start, I would like to do an Acknowledgement of Country. We acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land on which each of you are living, learning and working from today. We pay respects to the Elders past, present and emerging and recognize the continuing connection and contribution to the land and waters. We would like to extend this respect to any First Nations People here today. \\nMoving to Slide 2 of the presentation, which gives a snapshot of our business. The group has evolved significantly over the past 2 years. And on this slide, is a snapshot of our operations. We are now primarily focused on delivering technical services in the telco and smart energy markets with the national reach and a network of over 1,000 employees and contractors, partnering with our customers to deliver their strategies. We have 25-plus years of experience, and our current operations are true to our foundations in the telco and television markets. We are committed to maintaining our position as a leading provider in these markets, and we are constantly exploring opportunities to improve and grow in these sectors. Richard will shortly expand on more detail on our operations and opportunities. \\nMoving to Slide 4, progressing our plan. The company implemented its three pillar horizon strategy in March 2022. And we are pleased to report that we have substantially completed the first two pillars. Now moving towards transformation. To recap, the business reviewed its operations and core capabilities with the outcome being an absolute focus on telco and adjacent markets. The group proceeded to divest its noncore assets, which is now substantially complete with APS Maintain divested to CBRE and APS Fire Queensland divested to Entire Fire. The company continues to market APS Fire New South Wales whilst [indiscernible] ensuring it's stabilized, focusing on its people and commercial outcomes. \\nIn our focus pillar, we have concentrated on our cornerstone clients who have been top performers for the majority of the financial year. We continue to focus on how we can partner with those clients and deliver additional services. Through this focus, we have significantly improved our rate of returns, which is reflected in our financial results. Moving forward, we expect similar returns from our underlying operations and further building on opportunities in our growth in emerging market sectors. \\nSlide 5, key highlights. This slide represents a snapshot of our performance metrics. Firstly, safety, which is our number one value and our focus on safety remains absolute. With over 3,000 work orders completed each and every day, we continue to roll out initiatives to enhance our safety experience. \\nBSA's continued operations have delivered strong financial results with headline revenue of $239.8 million and EBITDA of $16.2 million, which is a material improvement to the prior period. The discontinued business performed below expectations due to focus turning to divestment and transition programs impacting operations. We continue to focus on improvement within the APS Fire business whilst we explore divestment options with interested parties. \\nI will now hand over to Richard, who will give an operational update on our continuing business.\\nThanks, Arno, and good afternoon all. Moving to Slide 7. We are proud to be a leading National Telco and Smart Energy Service Delivery Partner to many of Australia's blue-chip clients. Our true partnership approach allows us to grow and retain these clients, including nbn, Foxtel and Vector over many years. \\nIn addition, our proven capabilities allow us to acquire new customers, including Telstra, Intellihub, GoEvie and Tesla. We believe there are solid growth opportunities within the telco sectors, which we operate in and significant future upsides within our smart energy sectors, including the emerging EV market. Aligned to our revised group strategy focus, we also have the leadership team to deliver on our growth plans. \\nMoving to key highlights, Slide 8. We delivered circa $240 million in revenue and $16 million in EBITDA with strong uplift in EBITDA monthly run rate from November 2022 onwards. This was driven by both favorable commercial negotiations across both nbn and Foxtel and a better margin work type mix. \\nOur client performance was impressive throughout the year, and we delivered best-in-class balance score -- KPI scores. We expanded our smart metering market share by mobilizing our new customer Intellihub during the year. And we'll continue to build on this foundation into FY '24. We entered the high-growth EV market with clients, including GoEvie, Ohmie and Tesla. Whilst the initial volumes have been relatively low, we expect exponential growth over the next 5 years and beyond as Australia cuts over on mass to EV. \\nIn terms of safety, we have pivoted towards the lead indicators of critical control checks, proactive hypo prevention and health and safety index survey, which we achieved on both -- which we achieved and above par industry score of 83%. As a people business, keeping our people safe is our number one priority. After this, keeping our people engaged is our next top priority, and we are pleased with our retention metrics. \\nMoving to Slide 9, which outlines our key focus on growth. In fixed line, we will capitalize on the nbn fiber to the premises customer migration push to higher speed plans and look to maximize opportunities from our significant nbn forecast pipeline. In wireless, we have refreshed our strategy and overall structure to better target the new wireless asset owners. This matches the industry shift as telco operators sold their wireless assets to super investment funds. Within our Smart Energy Solutions pillar, as previously mentioned, we expect significant growth across smart metering and EV. \\nMoving on to Slide 10. The safety of our people is a nonnegotiable. We work safe and we go home safe is our key value. Our approach to safety is multifaceted and anchored by our BSA 7 Absolutes, which outline how we mitigate our top 2 safety risks of working with energy and working at heights. We have a highly skilled safety team, which supports our frontline leaders and workers to ensure we are making safe choices every day. Our health and safety management system is certified to ISO and Office of Federal Safety Commissioner Standards. \\nContinuing on safety, moving to Slide 11. We have completed a number of key initiatives as part of our health and safety strategy, including our annual stop for safety day, critical control check program, mental health first aid training and safety leadership training. We are pleased to have scored well above benchmark in our health and safety index survey. Our TRIFR rate increased slightly during the year. We will continue to execute our health and safety strategy, which proactively focuses on lead indicators to improve our safety metrics moving forward. \\nMoving on to Slide 12, our key contract overview. Of the three contracts up for renewal in FY '24. Firstly, Foxtel has exercised their right to extend by 1 year from 1 November 2023 to 31st of October 2024. They have one further 1-year extension option under the current agreement. Secondly, TPG has recently extended to 2025. And thirdly, the Intellihub initial 1-year agreement automatically rolls over into year 2, and we are currently in discussions with Intellihub on a new longer-term agreement. \\nThank you. And I'll now hand you back over to Arno  to take you through the remainder of the presentation.\\nThanks, Richard. Moving to Slide 14, discontinued operations. The APS Maintain division was divested in February successfully for $21.7 million before transaction costs. Our people have transferred successfully, and we continue to work on a successful transition with CBRE, which is targeted for completion by 31 December 2023. \\nOnce this transition is complete, it will enable further focus on our core operations. Our Fire Queensland business was divested to Entire Fire in June 2023. Entire Fires, Managing Director, Rod Sekulich previously led the BSA Fire division, which resulted in an efficient transaction. Transition on this divestment is already substantially complete. \\nAs for APS New South Wales Fire, it remains an asset held for sale, and we continue to evaluate options for its divestment. The process will involve engaging with potential buyers, evaluating offers and negotiating terms of sale. We believe the New South Wales Fire business would benefit from investment from external parties that are aligned to that division's growth. \\nIn the meantime, we continue to manage APS Fire as a distinct operating segment, and we are taking measures to optimize its performance, including commercial focus and changes to senior management. We remain committed to the people and clients of that division whilst finding the best outcome, and we'll keep the market updated on any developments in this area. \\nSlide 16. As can be seen, revenue of $239.8 million was broadly in line with FY '22. Overall returns, however, have significantly improved. This is as a direct result of stable volumes, favorable margin mix, prior mobilization is now completed and reaping the benefits of a revised operating model. All of these factors have led to a $12.1 million improvement in EBITDA on a stable revenue platform. The current delivery of revenue and margins is considered maintainable and in line with client volume forecast. \\nAnother key item to note is that during the current period, we did not report any significant items. The prior year items primarily relate to the settlement of the transaction, goodwill write-off and disputed tax positions. The gain on sale of divestment is separately disclosed and does not form part of ordinary operations. Depreciation and amortization relates to right-of-use assets, which decreased significantly post divestment. Overall, the group showed a significant improvement of $43.8 million, reporting a net profit of $5.9 million from continuing operations. \\nFor full reconciliation between statutory financial results and continuing financial results, please refer to Page 20. \\nSlide 17, funding. To continue our relationship with CBA, who have supported us during the financial year. Our facilities compromised $15 million in debtors financing previously $37.5 million, which now aligns to our revised operations post divestment. As of 30 June '23, we have $11 million in debtors financing facility available, $6.6 million guarantee and bond funding available and $2 million cash at bank. \\nMoving to Slide 18. The cash flow table illustrates -- illustrated on this page includes both continuing and discontinued operations. Overall cash flow has been materially impacted by previously provided items amounting to $11 million. These include the second tranche of the transaction payment as well as legacy legal cases. In FY '24, the final payment of $9 million relating to the class action settlement will be made. Working capital terms with key clients have now stabilized, and we expect minimal go-forward impact. Proceeds from sale of business includes both APS Maintain and Fire Queensland businesses, net of associated transaction costs. Overall free cash flow has improved by $15.9 million to a net outflow of $0.2 million. \\nMoving to Slide 19, balance sheet. Our balance sheet has been impacted due to the divestments, specifically working capital balances. Key items remaining in our balance sheet include PP&E, which contains some software, right-of-use assets and associated liabilities, which have decreased due to the divestments, deferred tax balances relating to timing differences on provisions and employee benefits, provisions which have materially changed as the prior year provision for class action crystallized and moved into payables and the remainder of the provisions represent legacy legal items, including disputed tax positions. \\nMoving to Slide 20. This slide provides a reconciliation between our continuing and discontinued operations and further includes the gain on divestment. Overall results have improved during the year due to the items outlined during the presentation. \\nMoving to Slide 22, which gives a summary of our year and short term -- near and short-term expectations. Our near-term focus remains on partnering with our cornerstone clients, which includes the delivery of their strategies, resulting in modest growth. We believe the strategies will enable us to scale operations with minimal disruption and maximum effectiveness as we remain agile to service those customers. We will continue to firm up our electric vehicle strategy as Australia continues to adopt the electrification of vehicles, and we continue our focus on APS Fire, ensuring the best outcome for both our people and the group. \\nLooking forward, we expect FY '24 financial performance to deliver similar results to FY '23 as client volumes firm up. In the mid- to long term, the group continues to target double-digit EBITDA growth, maximizing returns to our shareholders. \\nThis concludes our investor presentation. Thank you for dialing in. I will now hand over to our operator and open for any questions.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# A) Global anchor + 14-day bins for transcripts\n","tx_filt = tx_filt.copy()\n","tx_filt[\"event_dt\"] = pd.to_datetime(tx_filt[\"event_dt\"], errors=\"coerce\")\n","tx_filt = tx_filt.dropna(subset=[\"event_dt\", \"ticker\"])\n","\n","anchor = tx_filt[\"event_dt\"].min()\n","tx_filt[\"interval\"] = ((tx_filt[\"event_dt\"] - anchor).dt.days // 14).astype(int)\n","\n","# one transcript per (ticker, interval): most recent in that bin\n","by_bin_tx = (\n","    tx_filt.sort_values([\"ticker\", \"event_dt\"])\n","           .groupby([\"ticker\", \"interval\"], as_index=False)\n","           .tail(1)[[\"ticker\",\"interval\",\"event_dt\",\"transcriptid\",\"full_text\"]]\n","           .sort_values([\"ticker\",\"interval\"])\n","           .reset_index(drop=True)\n",")\n","\n","print(\"Transcripts by-bin:\", by_bin_tx.shape)\n","by_bin_tx.head()"],"metadata":{"id":"RIMib9Fgj4V1","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":224},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1760028609195,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":18,"user":{"displayName":"Beihan Niu","userId":"05557995590675718675"}},"outputId":"c8270c82-3e39-429b-d01b-97116cb97f82"},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Transcripts by-bin: (89, 5)\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["  ticker  interval            event_dt  transcriptid  \\\n","0  GOOGL         0 2023-08-02 23:26:13     2866669.0   \n","1  GOOGL         1 2023-08-16 22:50:31     2886964.0   \n","2  GOOGL         2 2023-08-30 22:54:08     2899513.0   \n","3  GOOGL         3 2023-09-13 20:57:57     2907954.0   \n","4  GOOGL         4 2023-09-27 21:49:02     2912862.0   \n","\n","                                           full_text  \n","0  Good afternoon.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Drew Borst, Vice President of Investor Relations.\\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our Fiscal 2025 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. With me today are Scott Howe, our CEO; and Lauren Dillard, our CFO. \\nToday's press release and this call may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a detailed description of these risks, please read the Risk Factors section of our public filings and the press release. A copy of our press release and financial schedules, including any reconciliation to non-GAAP financial measures, is available at investors.liveramp.com. Also during the call today, we'll be referring to the slide deck that is also available on our IR website.  \\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\\nThanks, Drew, and thank you to everyone joining us today. We had a strong financial performance in Q4. We beat on the top and bottom line. For the fifth consecutive quarter, revenue increased by a double-digit rate. The operating margin expanded by 3 points, driving 43% growth in operating income, and we had a record free cash flow quarter. These, in my view, are the standout achievements in the quarter.  \\nLauren will provide an in-depth look at the numbers shortly. I'll be focusing my comments on the key takeaways from the fiscal year just completed, and then diving into the exciting opportunities that lie ahead in FY '26.\\nFY '25 was a year of strong progress and achievement. First, we delivered 13% revenue growth, marking the third consecutive year that we hit our 10% to 15% revenue growth target. This was propelled by double-digit growth in both Subscription revenue, which grew 11%, and marketplace and other, which surged 21%. This growth was driven by our ongoing ability to win with the largest customers. We added 13 $1 million-plus Subscription customers during the year, including 3 in Q4. This crucial customer cohort saw aggregate revenue increase 13% in FY '25, exceeding our overall subscription revenue growth rate.  \\nNotably, in the fourth quarter, we signed 2 new $1 million-plus customers from the financial services sector to support their emerging commerce media networks. These additions include a leading global digital payments platform and the nation's largest bank and credit card issuer. Furthermore, we continue to successfully upsell existing clients into the $1 million-plus cohort. For example, a leading global security software provider signed on to leverage our Clean Room solution for enhanced collaboration with its PC partners, achieving a more comprehensive understanding of its customer base across its indirect and direct sales channels.  \\nWe also celebrated a record-setting quarter for renewals, securing 20 multimillion-dollar ACV contracts, of which roughly half are multiyear contracts. Among these renewals is IPG, one of our largest customers. As a result of these signings, we had substantial growth in our remaining performance obligations, which helps secure future revenue generation.\\nAnother driver of our revenue growth in FY '25 was a reduction in our contraction rate, which includes both dollar churn and down sell, to the lowest level ever. This achievement is the culmination of a sustained effort to enhance our service capabilities and modernize our platform on both the front and back end. Key initiatives included 2 platform refreshes last year that significantly improved the UI and the ongoing migration to an upgraded back end, which is yielding substantial improvements in stability and processing speed. With half of customer workflows already migrated and the remainder slated for this year, we are confident in sustaining these lowered contraction rates.  \\nGiven our scale and favorable fall-through rates, this top line growth translated into impressive bottom line gains. Our operating margin expanded by 2 percentage points to 18%, marking our sixth consecutive year of margin expansion. Additionally, we achieved a record $153 million in free cash flow, a 51% year-over-year increase driven partly by tighter management of working capital.\\nDemonstrating our commitment to shareholder value, we returned $101 million in cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program. We concluded the fiscal year with $421 million in cash and short-term investments, equating to over $6 per diluted share. Finally, bringing this all together, we proudly joined the Rule of 30 club in FY '25, or more accurately, Rule of 31, with 13% revenue growth and an 18% operating margin, a significant 4-point improvement from FY '24's Rule of 27. And while this is a nice milestone, we remain focused on our ambition to achieve the Rule of 40 by FY '28, targeting 10% to 15% revenue growth and 25% to 30% operating margin.\\nFY '26 opportunities. While FY '25 was an exceptional year, what excites me even more is the immense potential I see in FY '26. In February, we hosted our annual user and partner conference, RampUp, in San Francisco. This event, without a doubt, is the highlight of my year. RampUp has evolved into the definitive collaboration catalyst for leaders at the intersection of marketing, technology and data science. It's remarkable to reflect on how a decade ago, when this event first started, RampUp only drew a few hundred attendees and almost exclusively from the ad-tech world. This year, we welcomed approximately 2,500 participants, including not only ad-tech leaders, but also representatives from hundreds of global brand powerhouses. Companies like Disney, Procter & Gamble, Uber and Delta, amongst many others.  \\nRampUp serves as a critical catalyst for our sales engine and jump starts the fiscal year ahead. At this year's conference, we spotlighted 4 transformative themes. First, LiveRamp's Data Collaboration Network comprised of over 900 leading advertisers, data platforms, publishers, data providers and commerce media networks, has unparalleled scale, neutrality, interoperability and connectivity necessary to deliver the outcomes marketers and media owners need. \\nOur primary focus is to amplify the network's density by continuing to add more nodes, and even more importantly, increasing the number of edges or connections between these nodes. This will not only exponentially increase the value of the network for all participants, but also significantly bolsters our revenue generation.\\nSecond, we are transforming media measurement with the industry's only scalable solution, enabling seamless marketing insights from a single platform. We announced the launch of Cross-Media Intelligence, a new capability that enables marketers to better measure and optimize advertising campaigns anywhere its customers are, with access to unified deduplicated reporting across screens and platforms. We see this measurement use case as a primary mechanism near term for increasing the density of our network, more nodes and more edges. We will dive deeper into this in a moment.\\nThird, commerce media networks are scaling to new industries beyond retail. More and more companies across a variety of sectors are realizing the benefits of data collaboration to more accurately measure business outcomes. LiveRamp can enhance the value and effectiveness of the ad inventory on commerce media networks through improved targeting and measurement capabilities. We have discussed this trend for some time now, but the proof points continue to accumulate.  \\nEarlier, I highlighted the account wins with the digital payments platform and the leading U.S. bank to build new commerce media networks. Over the past year, our platform has helped launch an airline media network with United, a casino media network with Mohegan and a real estate media network with RE/MAX. We expect this trend to continue as companies look to better leverage their data assets to drive both efficiencies and incremental revenue.\\nFourth and finally, data collaboration with strong governance is foundational for AI and agentic marketing solutions. Data collaboration helps partners safely leverage important data sets, audiences, impressions, transactions to power agentic AI across all advertising channels so they can deliver and optimize outcomes-based marketing. Importantly, the LiveRamp Data Collaboration Platform also provides governance tools that allow data owners to control how their data is accessed and used, ensuring control and transparency. All of these trends are pivotal to our growth trajectory in FY '26 and beyond.  \\nBut what truly ignites my excitement is our groundbreaking Cross-Media Intelligence solution. The long-standing multi-touch attribution and panel-based measurement methods are faltering in today's complex multi-platform digital ecosystem. Relying on outdated tools, flawed metrics and fragmented third-party data provides only a distorted view of consumer behavior, leaving marketers to make critical decisions with incomplete and unreliable information. These antiquated approaches simply lack the precision and granularity demanded by effective cross-media advertising strategies. This often results in misallocated resources and skewed perceptions of campaign performance across platforms.  \\nAs our industry navigates increasingly stringent privacy regulations and the erosion of third-party cookies, the imperative for a robust privacy-centric measurement solution has never been greater. Data collaboration powered by our state-of-the-art Clean Room technology is the definitive solution to this measurement challenge. It represents a fundamental paradigm shift, enabling marketers to revolutionize their measurement strategies. Our solution equips them with unparalleled capabilities, seamless connectivity to a vast and diverse network of partners, the agility and control to enforce their unique data sharing policies and remarkable adaptability in the face of evolving regulations.  \\nThis data collaboration framework dramatically reduces risk and supercharges cross media measurement, empowering marketers to confidently navigate the complexity of the digital landscape without compromising privacy or data quality. LiveRamp is uniquely positioned to deliver this transformative measurement vision. We've established the industry's most extensive data collaboration network, seamlessly connecting all key players, from advertisers and publishers to retail media networks, data providers and measurement partners. Our robust identity foundation enables privacy preserving data connectivity across this network. \\nFinally, our network solutions ensure seamless interoperability across all major cloud environments. We've already secured commitments from dozens of premier publishers for Cross-Media Intelligence, including the largest social walled gardens. Everyone wants to know that their efforts are generating impact. In good markets, it's a priority, but in uncertain macroeconomic markets, it's a necessity. \\nIn addition, there is a serendipitous and important additional benefit. Collecting signals from a wider variety of partners feeds the proprietary AI models that we believe are foundational for long-term success. Increasingly, we're seeing the distance between measurement and optimization narrow with the rise of agentic optimization and curation. We're investing to power the emerging generation of data-driven optimization with agents.  \\nIndustry enthusiasm with both publishers and advertisers has been palpable, and Cross-Media Intelligence could be one of the key levers in driving more meaningful sales acceleration in FY '26. While measurement is not the only use case for our Clean Room Insights product, we think it is the most compelling one in the near term. As we discussed on Investor Day last February, today, only 25% of existing brand customers are utilizing a Clean Room from us today. But we think a significant majority of the remaining 75% will require one in the coming few years.  \\nFurthermore, the ARR for customers with a Clean Room is approximately 4x larger than customers without a Clean Room, demonstrating this sizable revenue opportunity from successfully upselling these customers. We also see this Clean Room measurement use case as a driver of new logo signings.\\nEnhanced measurement helps marketers optimize ROI and maximize every advertising dollar. This is always important, but even more so in a more tepid macroeconomic environment, when all expenses are under more scrutiny. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters ahead.  \\nIn closing, let me reiterate my key points. First, we delivered strong financial results in Q4, beating on the top and bottom line, delivering double-digit revenue growth for the fifth consecutive quarter, 43% operating income growth and a record free cash flow quarter. Second, FY '25 marked our entry into the Rule of 31 club with 13% revenue growth and 18% operating margin. The achievement was fueled by our continued success with our largest customers, coupled with a historic reduction in our contraction rate.\\nBut we're not satisfied. Looking forward, we remain confident that we will achieve our Rule of 40 by FY '28 with 10% to 15% revenue growth, and 25% to 30% operating margin and are working on initiatives to help us achieve these ambitions. Third, we anticipate meaningful incremental growth in FY '26 and beyond, propelled by our innovative Cross-Media Intelligence capability that enables marketers to better measure and optimize advertising campaigns anywhere their customers are with access to unified deduplicated reporting across screens and platforms.\\nThank you again for joining us today. I also want to thank our exceptional customers, partners and all LiveRampers for their ongoing hard work and support. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress in the coming quarters. With that, I'll turn the call over to Lauren.\\nThanks, Scott, and thank you all for joining us. Today, I'll review our Q4 financial results and then provide our outlook for FY '26 in Q1. Unless otherwise indicated, my remarks pertain to non-GAAP results, and growth is relative to the year ago period. I will be referring to the earnings slide deck that is available on our IR website. \\nStarting with Q4. In summary, we delivered strong results above our expectations, highlighting another quarter of solid performance and rounding out another year of forward progress. Revenue came in at $189 million, $4 million above our guide. And operating income was $23 million, $1 million above our guide. Operating margin expanded by 3 points to 12%. ARR increased by $12 million (sic) [ $13 million ] quarter-on-quarter, the second highest increase in the past 12 quarters on a like-for-like basis. And finally, free cash flow more than doubled to a record quarterly high.\\nLet me provide some additional details. Please turn to Slide 5. Total revenue was $189 million, up 10%, with both subscription and marketplace above our expectations. Subscription revenue was $145 million, up 9%. Fixed subscription revenue was up 8%, in line with our high single-digit expectation. Subscription usage was up 10%. Usage revenue as a percentage of total subscription revenue was 15%, in line with the mid-teens trend. ARR was $504 million, up 8% year-on-year. And as I mentioned, quarter-on-quarter grew by $12 million (sic) [ $13 million ] driven by net upsell and new logo.\\nSubscription net retention was 104%, in line with our 100% to 105% expectation. The decrease quarter-on-quarter was driven primarily by lower usage revenue associated with political advertising in Q3, and to a lesser extent, the lapping of the Habu acquisition. Total RPO or contracted backlog was up 25% to $710 million, and current RPO was up 14% to $471 million. Total RPO reflects the renewal of several multiyear million dollar-plus contracts, including a renewal with one of our largest customers, IPG. We're very pleased with our recent renewal activity, which underscores the mission-critical nature of the solutions we provide.  \\nTurning to the selling environment. I'd characterize the quarter as generally positive, though with a note of caution. As mentioned, we saw strong performance in large contract renewals and expansion with existing customers. However, new logo signings proved more challenging. While our pipeline conversion rate remained consistent with historical averages, we did see a modest lengthening of our average deal cycle. We believe this is partly due to the ongoing need to educate the market on our newer Clean Room solutions. In addition to that, late in the quarter, we did observe some customer hesitancy tied to macro uncertainty.\\nLooking ahead, we continue to see strong demand signals and our sales pipeline is robust, and we remain cautiously optimistic that sales momentum will accelerate if current macro conditions hold. Notably, a couple of the large deals that slipped out of Q4 have already closed in the early weeks of Q1, giving us a solid start to the new fiscal year.  \\nMarketplace and other revenue increased 14% to $44 million. Data marketplace, which accounted for 77% of marketplace and other revenue, grew by 13%, reflecting continued strength in U.S. digital ad spending. Here, we did not detect any change in customer behavior in either the fourth quarter or in April as a result of the macro.\\nMoving beyond revenue. Gross margin was approximately 72%, down 3 points year-on-year due to temporarily higher cloud hosting expenses related to our platform modernization. As discussed at our recent Investor Day, this initiative has been a big focus of our product and engineering teams, and we will be nearing completion as we enter the fiscal second half.  \\nOperating expenses were $113 million, flat year-on-year and in line with our expectations. Operating income was $23 million, up from $16 million a year ago, and our operating margin expanded by 3 points to 12%. GAAP operating loss was $12 million, reflecting the impact of restructuring charges associated with the 5% reduction in force announced in March, as well as stock-based comp and purchased intangible asset amortization.  \\nStock comp was $24 million, down 2% year-on-year. Free cash flow was a record $62 million, more than double a year ago, reflecting growth in adjusted EBITDA and improved working capital efficiency, particularly on collections. It was also a record year for free cash flow at $153 million, up over 50% year-on-year.  We repurchased $25 million in stock in the fourth quarter, bringing the FY '25 total to just north of $100 million.\\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter, there was approximately $256 million remaining under the current authorization that will expire on December 31, 2026. Our balance sheet remains in a very strong position with 0 debt and cash and short-term investments totaling $421 million.  \\nIn summary, we delivered strong Q4 results, and despite selling pressure in the first half of the year, closed out another solid fiscal year. Revenue grew by double digits in the fourth quarter and was up 13% for the full year. We expanded operating margin and achieved a Rule of 31 performance for the full year. Finally, we posted record cash flow for both the quarter and the year with free cash flow growing more than 50% year-on-year, underscoring the efficiency and scalability of our business model.\\nLet me now turn to our financial outlook for FY '26 in Q1. Please turn to Slide 12. Please keep in mind, our non-GAAP guidance excludes intangible amortization, stock comp and restructuring and related charges.  \\nStarting with the full year. First, in light of elevated macro uncertainty and the potential impact it may have, mostly on our variable revenue, our guidance incorporates a wider-than-normal revenue range. While we have fairly high visibility on 70% of our revenue from contracted fixed subscription and services, the remaining 30% of revenue in data marketplace and subscription usage is variable and is sensitive to macro conditions in so far as softer economic growth typically results in lower advertising activity.  \\nWith that said, we expect FY '26 revenue to be between $787 million and $817 million, which is growth of between 6% and 10%. Let me elaborate on the assumptions underpinning the range. Starting with the high end, we assume a relatively stable economy, broadly consistent with the trend over the trailing quarter or 2. More specifically, the high end assumes subscription revenue grows high single digits, with subscription growth accelerating in the second half. The high end also assumes marketplace and other revenue grows mid-teens. The low end of our range, in contrast, assumes macroeconomic growth decelerates in the fiscal second half, consistent with consensus economists' forecast. This would result in a deceleration in subscription usage and data marketplace growth in the back half of our year.\\nThe low end assumes subscription revenue grows mid-single digits and that marketplace and other grows high single digits. In contrast to the high end, the low end assumes subscription growth does not accelerate in the second half due to a more difficult selling environment.\\nSo to quickly summarize our revenue guidance. The difference between the low and the high end of the range is really the macro environment. Beyond that, it will come down to how well we execute and specifically, the sales momentum we generate in the first half with the Clean Room and Cross-Media Intelligence opportunity. We think the low end is fairly derisked, given it assumes a low growth macro environment in the second half and would imply a large step down from current levels.\\nWe expect gross margin to be roughly consistent with last fiscal year. We expect first half gross margins to be in the low 70s, and in the second half, normalized to the mid-70s as we finish migrating customers to our new platform back end. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be between $178 million and $182 million. At the midpoint, this represents 33% growth and a margin of 22%, up 4 percentage points year-on-year. The combination of offshoring and general cost discipline, including leveraging the acquired Habu expense base, is affording us the ability to invest in key growth areas, while at the same time, driving margin expansion.  \\nKey investment areas this year include supporting the expansion of our network and the amount of utilization on it, ensuring a successful rollout of our Cross-Media Intelligence offering, integrating AI functionality into our platform, and finally, our pricing transformation efforts. Stock-based comp is expected to be down 24% year-on-year to $82 million, reflecting a more disciplined approach to share-based compensation over the last couple of years. We expect GAAP operating income to be between $85 million and $89 million, equating to a margin of 10% to 11%.\\nLastly, we expect another year of strong free cash flow, and again, expect to use a substantial portion of this year's free cash flow for share repurchases. We will continue to be opportunistic, depending on market conditions.  \\nNow moving on to Q1. We expect total revenue of approximately $191 million, non-GAAP operating income of $33 million and an operating margin of 17%, up 2 points year-on-year. A few other call-outs for Q1. We expect Subscription revenue to be up mid-single digits. Marketplace and Other revenue is expected to be up mid-double digits. And finally, we expect gross margin to be roughly similar to Q4 as we work through the final phases of our platform upgrade and migration efforts.  \\nBefore opening the call to questions, I'll conclude with a few final thoughts. First, we had a strong Q4 ahead of our expectations on the top and bottom line, reflecting strength with existing customers and healthy digital ad markets. We like our position and momentum entering fiscal '26 and believe in our long-term opportunity. That said, given the macro environment, we've built a heavy dose of conservatism into our guidance range and specifically the low end of the range to derisk our back half, should macro conditions worsen. And finally, we continue to strategically manage expenses and expect our operating margin to expand by approximately 4 points, driving more than 30% growth in operating income.  \\nOn behalf of all LiveRampers, thank you again for joining us today, and thank you to our amazing customers and partners. Operator, we will now open the call to questions.\\n[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shyam Patil with Susquehanna.\\nCongrats on the solid quarter outlook. I had a couple of questions. First one for Scott. Scott, on Cross-Media Intelligence, I know you mentioned that a little bit in the prepared remarks, new product. I think you announced it a few months ago. Can you talk about how customer reaction has been so far? And what gives you confidence that it can accelerate growth? And then I have a follow-up.\\nThis is Drew. Just before we get -- Scott gets going on that question. I just wanted to clarify earlier when we posted the earnings press release, there was a mistake with respect to the outlook, particularly with operating income. The current PR that's up on the website has since been corrected, but I just wanted to make sure everybody understood that. The guidance that we gave on the call just now is accurate, but I just wanted to clarify that for everybody. I'll pass it back to Scott to answer the question on Cross-Media Intelligence.\\nAll right. You gave me more time to prepare. So Shyam, thanks for the question. First off, I would tell you I'm really optimistic about our Cross-Media Intelligence solution. To me, it feels like the Holy Grail that I've been chasing for most of my adult life in advertising. \\nShort term, just to dive into what it is, it allows advertisers to see kind of their holistic media performance. And they really want that. And what I would also say is marquee publishers also want it, as they feel they aren't getting enough credit for the results that they're driving. Particularly when it comes to in-store sales, things that happen off-platform.  \\nIt was designed with the input of both major advertisers and with feedback from key publishers. And we had participation from the walled gardens and all the major CTV providers. If you recall at Analyst Day, we talked about how well we are aligned with the secular trends, in particular, social, commerce media and CTV. And those are the publishers that have really leaned into this effort.  \\nAnd so while we demoed the capability, you saw it at RampUp, and we received really strong feedback. We actually formally launched it at our sales kickoff just a couple of weeks ago. Early reaction is good, but it's early. We've already had over 30 customer conversations. Our insights and measurement pipeline has more than doubled. And more broadly, I would tell you that, again, it's early. So let me caveat that. Our bookings for the quarter a month plus in are up nicely relative to the same period last year. So it suggests we're getting some traction.  \\nAnd then importantly, I think what gives me the most optimism isn't short term at all, but kind of the longer-term realization that we know that as clients extend into Clean Room and Insights, their spend with us increases and their churn falls dramatically. So if we can get traction here, it really bodes well for the second half of the year and our ability to accelerate our top line.\\nThank you, Scott. That's very helpful. Lauren, I had a question for you as well, just on the guidance -- on the revenue guidance range. I know you talked about the macro really being one of the main factors impacting the low end versus high end. But I was just wondering, can you maybe just talk a little bit more about just what the key factors are? I mean, key factors between the low and high end of the revenue range for the year?\\nYes, sure, happy to. And you called it out. I mean, in short, the biggest swing factor between the low and the high end is the macro environment. At the high end of our range, we're assuming a stable macro throughout the fiscal year. However, on the other hand, the low end assumes that U.S. macro growth decelerates meaningfully in the back half, which would pull down the growth rates of our variable revenue streams, specifically data marketplace and subscription usage in the second half of the year. \\nSo as an example, in the low case, we've assumed that subscription usage growth is flat to down in the second half and marketplace growth would moderate to mid-single digits in the second half. And then the delta between the mid and the high end or even how we get above the high end really comes down to execution, and specifically sales execution against our Clean Room strategy in the early part of this fiscal year, just given the in-year revenue contribution from deals that we closed in Q1 and Q2. \\nScott just talked about our Cross-Media Intelligence opportunity. We believe this is a very compelling use case for our Clean Room. In addition, we continue to add new connectivity partners. AI start-ups like Perplexity and Chalice, as well as more established platforms like Netflix, which should drive upsell activity in the early part of the year.\\nExcellent. Thank you, Lauren. Thank you, Scott.\\nThanks, Shyam.\\nYour next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter with Morgan Stanley.\\nIt's really good to see the strength of the existing customers. And when it comes to the new side of the equation, you guys have done a lot, whether it's Habu or strategic decisions like pricing, give you the opportunity to go after that new customer, particularly in the mid-market. So I just wanted to get a better sense for where you are on this opportunity. What steps have you taken that you feel confident on and what might need a little bit more time? And then just kind of related, if you could sneak in a comment on the logos in Q4. Is that just a shift from direct channel relationship's or anything else to be aware of?\\nYes, I'm happy to. And specifically for the quarter, the trends were very similar to past quarters. So the decline in customer count was, again, largely driven by smaller customers with relatively low ACVs. However, at the same time, our $1 million-plus customer count continued to grow very nicely. \\nSpecifically, in the quarter, international was the big driver of the pressure on customer count. It contributed to just over half the decline. And here, and we discussed this on the last call and at Investor Day, we're migrating customers from a direct to reseller arrangement with one of our large international partners. So keeping the revenue, but pressuring customer count. The good news is we're nearing the end of that migration. \\nLooking ahead, to your point, we're focused on improving this metric. We would expect it to stabilize and then would expect improvement as we move through the year, and we think this will be driven by a couple of factors. First, new Clean Room use cases like the Cross-Media Intelligence use case that Scott and I discussed, as well as new connectivity use cases. I just mentioned Perplexity, Chalice, Netflix, among others.  \\nAnd then second, and this is going to be more medium term to your question, Elizabeth. We believe our new pricing model should help here, as it lowers the cost of entry for mid-market customers. I wouldn't expect FY '26 to see a lot of benefit from that. We intend to pilot our pricing model this summer and roll it out more broadly at the beginning of next fiscal year. But over the medium term, we certainly believe this will be a driver of improving customer count. And then just a final note on FY '26, we would continue to expect $1 million-plus customer count to grow as it has in the past handful of years.\\nGreat. And then just as a follow-up, I was hoping to get some comments on the Google announcement in April about the third-party cookies remaining its current opt-out functionality. You guys had a really helpful blog post, but just hoping you could expand a little bit more on what you're hearing from customers, any sort of reaction to the news?\\nWell, I'd tell you, Elizabeth, for -- I think, what's almost out exception from our customers, it was a nonevent. Very quietly, but methodically, the world has moved away from cookies since Google first made their announcement, what, 4, 5 years ago. It is now the case that more -- we have greater reach through non-cookies than we do through cookies. \\nAnd that's a function of the fact that so many of our publishers on Netflix, Meta, Google itself, they require direct authentication. And that direct authentication, which is now the case at virtually all 20 of the 20 largest publishers worldwide, it's just going to unlock better reach and more granularity. And so a little bit of a yawn. I think that said, it's good news for the industry because they can take their time with anybody who's not prepared. And they also get the benefit of additional reach through cookies, which we continue to support.\\nAnd those are going to be valuable at times when someone is doing more of a broadcast broad reach campaign. So our message to our publishers and advertisers are alike are don't worry, regardless of what happens, you're going to be well supported.\\nYour next question comes from the line of Jason Kreyer with Craig-Hallum Capital Group.\\nGood job again. Lauren, I wanted to go back to your comments on the sales pipeline. So you said you've seen some hesitation from clients late in Q4. Curious if that continued kind of into the first half of Q1? And then kind of that theme of hesitation or longer sales cycles, should we assume if that continues, is that more midpoint of the guide? Or would that take us somewhere else in that guidance range?\\nJason, maybe I'll start, and I'll let Lauren speak to the guide. But I would tell you, overall, clients like certainty. And the past 12 months, we've had anything but certainty, whether it be the election, whether it be tariffs, whether it be more recently the deficit or fears about the impact of AI. But it is always the case that in recessions, great companies take share.  \\nAnd the message here really matters. ROI is always important to our clients and partners. But in times of uncertainty, it is absolutely a necessity. So we have really sharpened our ROI models, our value calculators, and we're doing a lot of economic analysis for our clients. Lauren mentioned the elongation in the sales cycle. The good news is we swept all that up in the first few weeks of April. So yes, flipped into the next quarter, but we were still able to drive it across the line. And I think by paying good attention to our pipeline and the things that clients care about, which are ROI, Cross-Media Insights, preparing for the future and winning, we have a really nice story to tell.\\nAnd Jason, just with respect to what's embedded in the mid kind of point of our guidance range. We've assumed similar conversion rates to what we saw in Q4, maybe with a touch of conservatism applied in the mid-case. That said, the low case assumes a pretty material tick down in conversion rates as we move through the year. And again, that is -- the low case assumes a much worse macro environment than we're experiencing, sitting here today.\\nVery helpful commentary. I also just wanted to ask, we saw one of your competitors acquired by an agency over the past quarter. Just curious if you think there's opportunity there or any risk there that we wouldn't be thinking about?\\nWell, we certainly don't think there's necessarily any heightened risk. You know -- listen, all the agencies are our partners. And when we talk to clients, they're always nervous about concentrating their technology spend or their data with folks who directly control their media, whether it be a media provider or a media buyer. \\nSo net-net, I think it's an opportunity. We love competition, but it makes us better. And relative to others in the industry -- I kind of joked the other day to our sales team that we're all about AI, always innovating. And if we do that, we're going to stay ahead of the rest of the industry. I really like the idea, the innovations that are coming down our pipeline.\\nYour next question comes from the line of Peter Burkly with Evercore ISI.\\nThis is Pete Burkly on for Kirk Materne. Scott, maybe for you. I'm curious, the Clean Room solution, you discussed the 4x ARR from customers with that solution, but only 25% of customers currently using it. So I'm curious, is there anything from a customer segmentation standpoint that would limit the ability for some portion of those customers to adopt that solution? Or is it more just a function of time and execution on your part?\\nWell, I think it is time and execution. For the past couple of years, the real driver to Clean Room adoption has just been the need for collaboration. You have major retailers, for instance, wanting to collaborate with their packaged goods partners. In that situation, everybody wins. But it's been the case that the adoption has proceeded most rapidly with the biggest companies, the largest retailers and the largest packaged goods manufacturers.  Over time, I think you'll see a greater adoption with everyone.\\nAnd the obstacle that we've seen in terms of pushing that down, part of it is our own doing. It's about standardization and scalability and education. We talk a lot internally about shortening the time to value, just making things easy to set up and see immediate value. And so we've simplified our product. We've standardized our queries. We talked about that a little bit on Investor Day. AI will make things even more intuitive and easy to use. \\nBut we think long-term, Clean Rooms are going to be the de facto standard for not just the large, but anyone. And the reason I say that is because public models for AI will only go so far. If you train on the world's public information, eventually, you get an asymptote on the results that you'll achieve. To break through that and generate better performance, you need to use proprietary data. And that proprietary data is the CRM data that every major company holds. And they want to collaborate with a lot of other companies, and they're only going to do that if they know that their data is secure. And the only way they can ensure the security is to use a Clean Room.\\nSo when we talk about AI, we're increasingly talking about how do we standardize the methodology by which AI models can ingest our clients' data safely and securely and ensure that advertisers and publishers maintain control over it. So I think secular trends here are at our back.\\nVery helpful. Thank you. And Lauren, maybe just a quick follow-up for you. Just thinking about NRR even directionally, I think you mentioned that a large part of the sequential decline was related to the usage portion on subscription, and then the lower factor being Habu. So I'm just curious, mechanically going forward and specifically related to your color with the low end of the guide sort of factoring in that lower use of subscription revenue. So is there a scenario where the NRR could continue to move lower from here? Or do you think we're at the low watermark? Just trying to understand directionally how that trends.\\nYes. Thanks for the question, Pete. So embedded in our guidance and guidance range is an assumption that subscription net retention is between 100% and 105% at least over the near term. So SNR in the first half of this year will be impacted by the selling pressure we experienced in the early part of fiscal '25. But we would expect improvement in the second half as we execute against the strategies that Scott laid out.  \\nMedium term, we continue to target 105% to 110% net retention, the biggest lever being the cross-sale of our Clean Room offering. In addition -- and Scott highlighted this in his prepared remarks, we made very meaningful progress in improving gross retention or bringing down contraction in FY '25. And we think there's still a little bit more juice to squeeze here. So in the near term, assume 100% to 105%. However, we feel confident in our ability to get back above 105% towards the end of this year or into next year.\\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz with Benchmark.\\nScott and Lauren. Nice to see the acceleration, both on ARR and RPO. The total RPO, it looks like, as far as I can tell, was the strongest sequential you posted since reporting the metrics. So I'm just curious if there were -- if you can maybe provide some color on what's unique about this renewal cycle and then how we might think about these large contract renewals converting to current RPO over time?\\nYes, it's a great question. And I think our headline would be we're really pleased with our progress here. We had a very successful quarter renewing large multiyear deals, which drove a 57% growth in the noncurrent portion of RPO. I think Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks, we renewed 20 deals with $1 million-plus ACVs, and more than half of those were on multiyear terms. So kind of the multiyear nature of the deal signings were really the biggest driver of the step-up. As we've mentioned, 30% of our subscription revenue is now on a multiyear contract, which we believe is very positive. It's a strong signal of the criticality of what we do for our customers.\\nGot it. And the data marketplace business, another -- it looks like a strong quarter. I'm curious if you think about Oracle contribution there as well as CTV contribution, was it incremental this quarter versus past? And just on CTV itself and sort of emerging CTV partnerships, are you perhaps starting to see some opportunities there, sort of a tailwind off of Netflix and Disney, if you will?\\nYes. Happy to take both great questions. With respect to Oracle, I think we mentioned this on the last call, just given the scale and breadth of our Marketplace business, it's hard to perfectly tease out the benefit from Oracle versus other factors. As an example, Oracle had about 45 data providers in its marketplace, and we were working with virtually all of them. Today, our marketplace supports just north of 200 data providers.\\nThat said, our best estimate is that Oracle added a couple few points of growth over the past 2 quarters, and we would expect a similar contribution over the next 2 quarters. With respect to CTV, I mean it was a real bright spot in our data marketplace in FY '25. For the year, data bought off our marketplace to support CTV advertising was up nearly 50%. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have a handful of big new CTV data marketplace partnerships that are coming live this quarter or next quarter, which we would expect to support continued strong growth here in FY '26.\\nYour next question comes from the line of Alec Brondolo with Wells Fargo.\\nSo look, 2 good quarters of RPO acceleration after the October product refresh. I think the lesson has to be that making the product easier to use or more intuitive drives bookings. So I think the natural question, what are the next -- what are the next 2 or 3 things you could do to continue making the product simpler for advertisers? That's the first question. \\nAnd the second question is on the Cross-Media measurement product. There is a group of kind of nascent deterministic multi-touch attribution platforms. I think Triple Whale is one, Northbeam is one. And so the question is, what's differentiated about LiveRamp's offering there in the market?\\nYes. So first off, in terms of product priorities, I'll answer it detailed, and then I'll bring it up and just talk about it in summary. Depending on which aspect of our portfolio you're talking about, remember, we have 4 pillars. And the priorities for each are a little bit different. On the identity pillar, it's really about expanding cloud interoperability and powering first-party data infrastructure such that our partners can achieve greater accuracy and scale. That just makes us more ubiquitous. \\nOn the access front, which is about access to data, it's increasingly about expanding the different providers in our marketplace, but then also allowing them not just to provide data, but really to provide models. I think over time, 5 years from now, we're not going to be talking about data elements, we're going to be talking about models. And so over time, I think our marketplace evolves to much more of a model AI-driven set of capabilities. And so we're thinking hard about that journey.  \\nOn the connectivity side, which is activating all the destinations where data can be utilized, well, really there, it's just about accelerating our efforts, expanding to new partners and use cases. Perplexity, for instance, or all the different CTV providers that are now going live, those are great examples. But also international, where our effective reach has been lower in many international markets than the U.S., and we're closing that gap in a way that our clients really are pushing us to do.  \\nAnd then finally, on the insights front, that's about interoperability, AI-driven usability, scalability, getting more partners involved. If there are some mega themes that go across all those things, I would say we are always driving for more usability. We want our products to be extremely usable and intuitive because we know that drives quicker adoption.\\nScalability. Our power users use our products in ways that we had never imagined. And we see the volume loads. And so we are constantly thinking about how to improve our throughput, our processing, our uptime. And there, it's just a -- it's a constant race to be better and better.\\nAnd then finally, functionality, where our clients are always pushing us in ways that we can't even imagine because they're bringing to us different partners, different use cases, different ideas. And so we're going to support those kind of quick twitch innovations that our partners want us to do. Our Head of Product, Matt Karasick, he talks a lot about, hey, we are going to build stuff that our clients and partners want to buy. We're going to build stuff where they generate value. And so we are pretty maniacally focused on what our clients and partners tell us they're trying to do, and we're always trying to solve their problems.  \\nOn your question about the Cross-Media insights and the competition that we could face there, what I would tell you is that we have always believed that we didn't -- we want to be a measurement enabler, not a measurement solution. And so we've built capabilities that power a lot of different other measurement providers. But what we're hearing from our partners is that what they're trying to do is so collaborative,  it is about how does an advertiser place an ad on a publisher and then measure the result of an in-store sale with another partner entirely. And so those lend them themselves not to kind of the traditional measurement solutions, but really the Clean Rooms. Because what people are trying to do is so unique.  \\nNow the configuration is oftentimes very custom, depending on which partners you're talking about. But the number of custom configurations can be pretty easily managed. Because you know like what a major merchant is trying to do with their different publisher partners and their different packaged goods partners, the names might change, but the use cases that they're trying to drive look pretty similar.  \\nSo the group that you mentioned, quite frankly, we don't come up against them in head-to-head selling. And I would say we'd be far more interested in how can we partner with them and help power their measurement solutions, whatever they are.\\nAnd Alec, maybe just to put a fine point on that because you asked specifically what differentiates our Cross-Media Intelligence offering to that of the companies you just mentioned. And I think to summarize what Scott said, it's really our network and the scale of our network. If you are trying to measure across multiple partners and on and offline, you need a network as big as LiveRamp. And today, no one else comes close.\\nSeeing as there are no further questions, I will now turn the call back over to Lauren Dillard for closing remarks.\\nThanks so much. Let me just finish with a few final thoughts. Again, we had a strong Q4, ahead of our expectations on the top and bottom line. We like our position and momentum entering fiscal '26 and believe in our long-term opportunity. That said, given the macro environment, we've built a heavy dose of conservatism into our guidance range and specifically, the low end of that range. And finally, we continue to strategically manage expenses and expect our operating margin to expand by approximately 4 points, driving more than 30% growth in operating income in fiscal '26.\\nWith that said, thank you again for joining. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters ahead.\\nLadies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.\",\n          \"Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. Welcome to the Penske Automotive Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay approximately 1 hour after completion through November 2, 2023, on the company's website under the Investors tab at www.penskeautomotive.com. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to introduce Anthony Pordon, the company's Executive Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Sir, please go ahead.\\nThank you, Lea. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. A press release detailing Penske Automotive Group's third quarter 2023 financial results was issued this morning and is posted on our website, along with the presentation designed to assist you in understanding the company's results. As always, I'm available by e-mail or phone for any follow-up questions you may have. Joining me for today's call is Roger Penske, our Chair and CEO; Shelley Hulgrave, EVP and Chief Financial Officer; Rich Shearing of North American Interoperations; Randall Seymore, International Operations, and Tony Facione, our Vice President and Corporate Controller. \\nOur discussion today may include forward-looking statements about our operations, earnings potential, outlook, future events, growth plans, liquidity and assessment of business conditions. We may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA and our leverage ratio. \\nWe have prominently presented the comparable GAAP measures and have reconciled the non-GAAP measures in this morning's press release and investor presentation, which are available on our website to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Our future results may vary from our expectation because of risks and uncertainties outlined in today's press release under forward-looking statements. I'd also direct you to our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and previously filed Form 10-Qs for additional discussion and factors that could cause future results to differ materially from expectations. At this time, I'll now turn the call over to Roger.\\nThank you, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Our diversified business really produced another solid quarter, driven by strong performance from our North American automotive and commercial truck operations. The strong performance in North America was partially offset by lower earnings from our U.K. automotive operations, higher interest expense and lower equity earnings from our investment in Penske Transportation Solutions. \\nAs previously announced, third quarter results include approximately $6.2 million of costs related to the loss of inventory, property damage and business disruption from a hailstorm in Austin, Texas.  It impacted our Toyota, Honda and Hyundai dealership, 750 vehicles worth $27 million in inventory. During the third quarter, total units delivered increased 12% to 122,000, which includes 8,695 agency units. Good news is revenue increased 8% to $7.4 billion, and our same-store retail revenue automotive increased 9%, including a 9% increase in service and parts. \\nSame-store retail automotive variable gross profit per unit declined $466 sequentially from the second quarter of '23 to $5,180. Same-store retail commercial truck gross profit increased 6%. Our net income was $263 million and earnings per share was $3.92. Last week, we increased the dividend by $0.07 or $0.10 to $0.79 per share. Let me now turn to our auto operations. Demand for new vehicles remains solid, and availability, I would say, is improving. \\nWe continue to take forward orders. Our U.S. presold inventory remains approximately 40% to 50%. In the U.K., our forward order book is 24,300 units and gross is only down 2%, representing about $98 million. Automotive operations in the U.K. during the third quarter were impacted by supply challenges, stop sales and a challenging used vehicle market. And of course, March is a registration month, so it's awful key for us from the standpoint of our operation and profitability. \\nOrders for 493 new vehicles were unable to be delivered in September. In addition, same-store used vehicle gross profit declined 30% as pricing challenges impacted the used market. Let's look at our retail automotive business on a same-store basis for Q3. Total units delivered increased 10%. Service and parts revenue increased 9% and gross profit, by the way, was up 10%. Service and Parts revenue growth has been driven by an increase of 10% in customer pay, 7% in warranty and 14% in collision repair. \\nOur variable gross profit remains strong and the higher than historical levels, obviously, for example, variable gross per unit of $5,180 is $2,000 per unit higher than it was in Q3 2019. Let me now talk a little bit about Penske Transportation Solutions. PAG owns 28.9% of PTS, which provides us with equity income, cash distributions and cash tax savings. PTS currently manages the fleet of over 442,000 trucks, tractors and trailers. In the third quarter, operating revenue increased 4% to $2.8 billion. Full service contract revenue increased 13%. Our logistics revenue increased 2%, while rental declined 9%. PTS generated $291 million of net income. Our share of PTS earnings was $84 million, which declined by $51 million compared to Q3 last year. However, the good news is our share of PTS earnings increased $11 million sequentially when compared to Q2 of 2023. \\nThe decline in PTS earnings over the prior year period was mainly impacted -- let me look at 4 items, particularly, supply constraints and lease extensions increased the number of older units in operation and drove higher maintenance costs of $40 million in Q3. We also granted 18,000 lease extensions so far this year and 37,000 if you look over the last 21 months. Interest expense increased $64 million due to higher average outstanding debt, obviously, and the growth of our fleet, combined with $1.5 billion in refinancings and overall higher interest costs, a lower gain on sale of $61 million when compared to the record performance in 2022 as used truck values declined from historically high levels in the past. Commercial rental utilization was 80% compared to 84% in the third quarter. \\nOur full-service long-term contract business remains very strong, increasing 13% in Q3. We believe the supply of new trucks is stabilizing and will provide PTS with an opportunity to replace the older vehicles in the fleet in the near future, and this obviously will drive lower maintenance expense. Also, we believe freight rates will begin improving in the near future, which has historically helped our remarketing profitability. \\nLet me now turn the call over to Rich Shearing to discuss our commercial retail operation trucks.\\nThank you, Roger. Our Premier Truck Dealership business represents 44 locations in North America and is an important part of our diversification. Earlier this year, we expanded into greater Winnipeg, Manitoba market area, acquiring 5 new locations and $180 million in estimated annualized revenue. Including the acquisition, our operations in Canada are approaching $1 billion in annualized revenue. These new dealerships have been fully integrated into our existing operations in Canada and are performing to expectation adding an important new market and significantly expanding our operations in Canada. \\nWe remain one of the largest commercial truck retailers for Daimler Trucks North America. New commercial truck demand remains solid and continues to be driven by replacement demand. our Class 8 allocation for 2023 remains sold out. Through September 30, North American Class 8 retail truck sales were up 13% to 248,000 units. The current industry Class 8 backlog is 161,000 units, representing approximately 6 months of sales. During the third quarter, same-store retail unit sales decreased 11% when compared to prior year due to production timing and delivery delays in calendar year 2022, resulting in higher-than-normal retail sales later in the year. \\nHowever, same-store gross profit increased 6% as gross margin increased on both new and used truck sales. Service and Parts represented 65% of total gross profit and covered 132% of fixed costs in the third quarter. Q3 increased 16% to a record $61 million and was the highest EBT quarter in the company history. As we look forward to 2024, our order book recently opened, and we are securing orders and expect another strong year of Class 8 sales. There's also good news on the freight front. After nearly 2 years of declining freight rates, a recovery is also forecasted in calendar year 2024. \\nLastly, I'd like to congratulate the team at Premier Truck Group for being recognized as the Truck Dealer of the Year for 2023 for its -- in its areas of customer responsiveness, workforce improvement and civic engagement. I would now like to turn the call over to Shelley Hulgrave.\\nThank you, Rich. Good afternoon, everyone. I would now like to walk you through several key financial highlights and discuss the strength of our balance sheet. We continue to focus on operational efficiencies through cost reductions, automation and other improvements gained over the last several years to help us maintain lower levels of SG&A to gross profit than historical averages.\\nSG&A to gross profit was 69.9% in the third quarter and is 800 basis points below the 77.9% in 2019, SG&A includes costs related to hail damage sustained during the quarter, which represented approximately 50 basis points of SG&A to gross profit. As a result of our efforts to gain efficiencies and control expenses in our U.S. automotive operations, compensation to gross profit ratio has improved by 30 basis points while Service and Parts absorption has improved 240 basis points when compared to last year. \\nLooking at our cash flow. We generated over $1 billion in cash flow from operations in the 9 months ended September 30, 2023. During this period, we repurchased 2.7 million shares for $365 million and returned $136 million in dividends to our shareholders. Last week, we increased the dividend by almost 10% to $0.79 per share. So far this year, we've increased the cash dividend by 39% from $0.57 to $0.79. We continue to maintain a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation. \\nYear-to-date, we have acquired $320 million in estimated annualized revenue, and we have a pipeline of more than $2.5 billion under consideration. For the first 9 months of 2023, 36% of our cash flow from operations funded share repurchases, 27% went to CapEx for growth and expansion, 21% to acquisitions and 13% to dividends. The remaining 3% of our cash flow from operations was used to repay non-trade floor plan. Our trailing 12-month EBITDA is nearly $1.8 billion. At the end of the quarter, our long-term debt was $1.7 billion. Approximately $1 billion of the long-term debt represents our subordinated notes with $550 million maturing in 2025 and the other $500 million maturing in 2029. \\nThe average interest rate on these notes is 3.6%. We also have $504 million in mortgages and $160 million in other borrowings at subsidiaries. Debt-to-total capitalization improved to 27.3% from 28.3% at the end of the second quarter. Leverage sits at 1x at the end of September. We also have the ability to flex our leverage up to 4x on a lease-adjusted basis, leaving significant opportunity for acquisitions and returning capital to shareholders. \\nOur U.S. credit agreement provides for up to $1.2 billion in revolving loans for working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, investments and other corporate purposes and was fully available at the end of September. At September 30, we had $104 million in cash, $415 million in vehicle equity and $1.4 billion in availability under our credit agreement. Total inventory was $3.7 billion, representing an increase of $200 million from December 31. Floor plan debt was $3 billion. \\nWe had a 34-day supply of new vehicles, including 30 days in the U.S. and 34 days in the U.K. Days supply of new vehicles for premium was 37 and volume foreign was 19. Our current days supply of new battery electric vehicles is 52 days in the U.S. and 38 days in the U.K. Used vehicle inventory had a 38-day supply. At this time, I will turn the call back to Roger for some final remarks.\\nYes. Thank you, Shelly. She mentioned our balance sheet is strong, safe and secure, obviously, with a capitalization ratio of 27% and a leverage ratio of 1.0x, we have the ability to flex our balance sheet to maximize capital allocation. As we said earlier, since 2018, we returned over $2.5 billion to our shareholders. For 9 months ended September 30, 2023, we generated $1.2 billion in earnings before taxes, and that's approximately, if you can believe it, double the earnings before taxes we generated for the full year in 2019. I think our results continue to demonstrate the benefit of our diversification across retail, automotive, commercial truck industries, cost control and a disciplined capital allocation strategy. \\nWe continue to challenge our cost while focusing on simplification and optimization and digitization to drive efficiency. I remain confident in our model and the performance of the business. Thanks for joining us today. I look forward to your questions.\\n[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from John Murphy.\\nJust a first question. You guys talked about this a bit, and Shelley gave us some numbers. But as far as inventory levels, as we think about the light vehicle business in the U.S. and the U.K., how much were you hampered by shortages? I mean some of the numbers don't sound too bad, and I think people are thinking that chip shortage is done, but reality is I think there's some -- the hiccups still there. And then on the commercial side as well, I mean, it sounds like you got real shortages there. When do you think those get resolved, it will take some time? And what kind of impacts are these having on the business?\\nOkay. Let's -- I put it in perspective, John. Our total inventory at the end of 9 months only went up $200 million. So obviously, we're still in a tight inventory situation. And then the impact in the third quarter because it's a registration month, in the U.K., almost 500 units that hit us there, obviously, that had some impact. And I think that at this point, we look at U.S. inventory today, is at 2 million units and pre-pandemic is at 3.6 million. And our inventory, obviously, is only up, I don't know what it is on a cost for sale, but obviously, it's not much when you look at 9 months. \\nBut I think right now, remember, we're premium, so we don't get the big swings in the domestics that they might have in the other companies. And our volume foreign, obviously, Toyota is one of our lowest day supply along with Honda, and it continues to be there. So anyhow, I'll let Rich talk about, Rich, what do you think about the truck inventory, where you see it as we go forward on heavy trucks.\\nYes, John, just clarification on comps. So we've seen a steadier supply this year of the commercial trucks. The comparison to the third quarter of last year was related to the peak and supply chain challenges at the beginning of 2022, mostly related to semiconductors and the commercial  vehicles from a production standpoint. And so those delays early last year pushed more retail sales into the third and fourth quarter of last year than what would have, say, normally occurred. \\nAnd so now that we're back to a more normal and even distribution of delivery from the OEMs, the comps look -- in comparison were down compared to Q3 of last year. So from an inventory standpoint, we're still, as I said, sold out on every truck that's being given to us. We've had minor cancellations that have been sucked up by other customers who haven't got enough trucks over the last couple of years. \\nAnd we're seeing the delays come down in body builders. This is a cab chassis manufacturing that goes to some sort of body company after the fact their supply chain is improving somewhat as well. And then if you look at overall commercial truck inventory, just from a numbers perspective, we ended last year at 506 million in inventory, and we're at 494 million today. So fairly flat across the board.\\nOkay. And then just a second one real quick. Your Parts and Service was particularly strong in the quarter. Roger, I don't know if you can talk about sort of the different channels, customer pay, warranty. I may have missed some of those numbers. But how should we think about that going forward because that remains a significant bright spot for the business, and it seems like there's even more opportunity going forward.\\nWell, I think the same-store talk same-store is really meaningful. Revenue was up 9.5%, and our gross profit was up 10.3%. And I think the key thing here is that we're implementing AI that's driving higher after-hour appointments, which we didn't have before. We're Tech Video. In fact, 74% of our [ rows ] in the West are using tech video now. So we're not only getting better clarification of the service but also ability to upsell. And then our ELR, our rate of -- that we charge the customer effective labor rate is up 5%. And we don't see BEV also not being a detriment to our fixed. In fact, it's really better right now because the parts costs are higher and many of these cars have to be in the shop for a longer period of time. So I think the other good news is that our tech count is up 4% in the U.S. and 3% up overall.\\nAnd just one follow-up on that. The ELR for warranty work, is that up in a similar rate? Or is that difference between customer pay and warranty...\\nI would say the warranty rate is, we have to go to the manufacturer at least on a 12 to 18 months, and we have to show established door rate, then they give us a rate. So we probably could move the door rate to the customer higher faster than we would get it from the OEM, but it somewhat follows that continuously.\\nNext, we will go to the line of Michael Ward.\\nSo it looks like basically, some of the supply constraints on the heavy-duty truck side are hitting you both on PTS and auto retail truck. And I'm just curious on PTS. If I did my math right, the fleet, the managed fleet has grown about 8% annually over the last decade. Is there any reason we won't continue to see that type of growth? And then you've also had exponential growth in the profitability, despite it being down year-over-year for some quirky things. But is that what we can expect from PTS going forward?\\nWell, I can say this. I think I've said it on the call, we want to be at 500,000 units by 2025. Now that will move up and down a little bit on rental utilization because right now, we're at 18,000, say, tractors in the rental fleet, probably moving it down to, say, 14,000 here while we go through a little slower period to maintain our 80% to 85% utilization. \\nBut I see no reason not to continue the continued growth. And now that's a mix. Remember now, the straight trucks, light-duty trucks, tractors and trailers. And I think the -- our tractor fleet is the biggest in the world right now, and we continue to grow. The problem is from our main vendors is getting the equipment. And they're -- we get -- one gives us trucks and the next one has a stop sale, et cetera. So I think when you look at our contract business, remember, if we're up 13% in contract that's for 1 year. And typically, these contracts now would go forward for 3 to 4 to 5 years. So we really have a trailing opportunity here. So I see this revenue continuing to grow. And obviously, it's easy for us to grow the fleet. We're not limited by franchise laws or any other things you might have on the automotive side.\\nAnd have you seen any easing in some of the constraints of the industry?\\nLet me let Rich, do you want to answer that?\\nYes. So Mike, you look at the parts side of the business, which really is an indicator of the challenges on the supply side of the business. And at its peak, there was 250,000 nationwide back orders from the dealers. And we -- at any given time, as an entity Premier Truck, we've had about 10% of those nationwide back orders. To put that number in perspective, it was -- less than 10,000 would have been prepandemic levels, less than 10,000 national back orders for all of the Daimler Truck North American dealerships. \\nSo right now, as we sit here today, it's just below 100,000. So it's come down significantly and the supply chain is improving on componentry but still 10x where it was say, pre-COVID levels. And then when you look at equipment, I just want to go back to our new unit sales. So we're up 8% on a -- through 9 months on a year-to-date basis. It's down 13% for the quarter. And that's the dynamics related to the supply chain of 2022, where a lot of retail sales got pushed later in the year. So we're still up on a year-to-date basis, 8% retail sales on the truck side.\\nAnd the pricing is still strong. And so that's another good indication.\\nThat's correct. Yes.\\nNext, we go to a question from Daniel Imbro.\\nRoger, maybe starting one on the new vehicle side, just thinking about GPUs have been strong, and they did step down a bit more. I wanted to maybe double-click on that. EV demand has been pretty tepid maybe at best. Can you talk about the GPU degradation or parse out what ICE GPUs are doing maybe from the first half into 3Q. And then what EV GPUs did? And maybe is that part of the reason for this deeper step down in profitability here, we saw a little bit in the quarter?\\nWell, we see growth is rationalizing. I think we've talked about it again before. We're not going to return to prepandemic for sure in the near future, I don't believe. And when you look at our business today, 52% of our business is at MSRP. So -- and again, being a premium luxury player like we are, we're not in the volume game. So we don't have -- as I said earlier, we might have 300 BMW stores and one of the big 3 has 6,000 dealers. So a lot more competition in the market. \\nSo I think that at the present time, our decline was about 450 sequentially. Again, when you look at the first quarter of '23 versus '19 or early -- or excuse me, first quarter this year, we're down 140. The key thing is certainly the average transaction price has gone from [ $40,000 ] in the third quarter in 2019 to [ 56.6% ]. So a certain amount of benefit we're getting is because of a higher cost base. And I think this gets us to a higher base margin. Well, obviously, it's got to be inventory driven. There's no question about it. But overall, I think the margin will stay pretty much the same but will start to decline slightly based on more availability. I'm going to let Randall talk a little bit about what you see internationally.\\nYes, I think on the new car side, remember that the market in the U.K. is nearly 17% -- 16.8% BEV, which is up slightly versus last year. We're -- because of our mix, we're higher than that. We're going to be, depending on the brand, we range between 20% and 25% on an average. So interestingly as well, we're seeing the BEV margins erode a bit. We wrote some business last year with deliveries this year towards the beginning of the year with better grosses. \\nBut on the BEV side, for some of the brands, it's a little bit weaker. Interesting on Mercedes as agency, we have a fixed commission, obviously, margin on that. And typically, the BEVs are more expensive. So our margin on those with Mercedes was bucking the trend a little bit better.\\nAnd I think also when you look at BEV sales here in the U.S., we're selling at 80% or under MSRP [indiscernible] talk a little bit probably about inventory on BEVS here, Rich.\\nYes. So we've seen sequentially an improvement actually on inventory from the second quarter. At the end of the second quarter, we were about 15% of our overall inventory with BEV. That's down to just over 11% through the end of the third quarter. Shelley alluded to the days supply earlier being about 14 days more than a comparable ICE inventory. And then you look at the percentage of our sales, it represents on a year-to-date basis that sale is about 6.7%.  That's up slightly 112 basis points from our percentage of sales through the second quarter. \\nAnd to Roger's point earlier, we're seeing -- and on average, with the brands that we represent about $2,400 lower gross profit per unit on the BEV sales. We've got to discount them to move them and as the OEMs are putting [ tons of money ] on there to try and drive customer demand.\\nI think talking about we're selling them too. I think it's interesting...\\nYes. So if you just look at it at an industry year-to-date -- sorry, 37% of year-to-date BEV sales are in California, but of our sales, the PAG sales, 51% are going to California. 70% of our sales are actually through our West region, which is Texas, Arizona and California. So you've got only 3 states right now in the United States that are above the national average sales rate, which is 8%, and that's Texas, California and in New Jersey. \\nAnd then if you look at California sales in Q3, it is 23% overall of sales were into California. So at some point, those markets are going to get saturated. And it's going to be a little more challenging in the other markets that currently have a lower adoption rate of BEVs compared to the national average.\\nYes. Randall, talk a little bit about BEV sales in the U.K. and the rest of Europe.\\nYes. So look, like I said, a little bit challenging. What I think an interesting statistic is it, specific in the U.K., the market's up, like we said, but retail is only up 2% and fleet's really driving this. And the BEVs are really coming through those fleet purchases as you get the tax incentive through the scheme they have in the U.K. And then you look at countries like Italy and Spain, where there's very, very little government incentives and you've got BEV percentages between 3.5% and 6% penetration. So it's really followed the incentives. And the challenge that we've seen from an infrastructure standpoint and range anxiety, all the usual items.\\nRandall, it's important to note, too, that the U.K. just within the last couple of months decided to push back the mandatory adoption of BEVs from 2030 to 2035. So I think that comes into play, and we should watch that carefully, too. So ICE will continue to be a more prominent player in that market, we think, for a longer period of time.\\nMost similarly, Tony, too California pushed back the ban of ICE vehicles as well.\\nThey did. That's right.\\nSo I think today, we've got a lot of people on premium side have bought their EV. There's still a discussion about range, correct?\\nYes.\\nObviously, that is critical. And then infrastructure, about half of it is working. And I think that you're reading it in the papers today. I mean we're pushing back -- I would have to say that every day we talk to our field, and we're talking about BEV inventory and talking about how much more do you want. It's what do you have, and we're very careful on used pricing also. What's your inventory in the U.S.?\\nInventory of used BEVs is 134 units.\\nWhat would it be -- you don't know what is in the U.K. But again, we're really watching it and I think the interesting we can actually take a BEV in on trade and sell it and get more for a used one gross profit than we can on a new one. So it's there's so many moving parts we can spend an hour here and talk about it.\\nNo, that was all extremely helpful. I'll follow up with one on the commercial truck side. Obviously, overall solid profit quarter, but we did see Service and Parts growth maybe moderate a bit. I'm trying to understand that in the context of what we said about PTS, fewer delivery for PTS means that fleet spending $40 million more year-over-year on maintenance costs. So I would think if fleets are spending more on maintenance, that would drive maybe more service and parts growth. Can you maybe talk about why has Service and Parts growth moderated and kind of what the buckets were within that piece on the commercial truck side.\\nYes. So if you look at fixed operations in the Premier Truck Group business, year-to-date, we're up 8% for the quarter. We were up 4% versus prior year. So definitely a slowdown slightly compared to prior year. If you look into that then a little bit deeper in the constituents of that of Service and Parts, the majority of that is going to be related to the retail and wholesale parts side of the business. So you've got -- on the wholesale side, you've got a big business there where we're selling to independent repair centers. Then on the retail side, a lot of [indiscernible] carriers transition or transport goods down the federal highway system. So you've seen as the freight rates have declined year-over-year that the activity and utilization of some of the assets has declined as well. And so that's where you're seeing a slight softening in the fixed operations side of the business.\\nI think we had a benefit out of price increases.\\nYes, we have some parts depreciation in calendar year 2022 as well that would not be in those comparables this year.\\nDaniel, we're still covering 132% fixed absorption. So not a bad story by any means.\\nNext, we go to Rajat Gupta.\\nCould you unpack the SG&A to gross in the quarter a little bit. How much of the sequential move was driven by just the GPU weakness versus some of the delivery delays in U.K. for BMW, Volkswagen? We heard from one of your peers that, that was an issue. And just like any other items that you might want to call out that might have influenced the SG&A  to gross? And I have a follow-up.\\nRajat, I can take that. As I mentioned, SG&A to gross was 69.9%, those 300 basis points, we've really whittled it down to 3 main areas. So as we mentioned, 5.5 million or 50 basis points related to the hail damage within the quarter. So we've got that. The other, there's another 100 basis points that relate to service loaners in vehicle maintenance. So up $11 million. \\nBut as we've talked about, service loaners represents an opportunity for us. It's a way to cater to our service customers and improve our service gross profit as we saw as a result but then it's also an excellent source of used cars. And then all of the peers have talked about, we're certainly struggling sourcing used cars. So the fact that we've got almost 7,400 of service loaners available really will be future gross profit for us, but it also helps with servicing our customers right now. So as they have affordability concerns, if somebody comes in, wanting to buy a new X5 and can't quite stomach the higher payment, we can turn to our service loaner fleet and that not only helps the customer, he's walking away with an almost brand-new X5. But his team is more in line with what he's used to. \\nSo sometimes those costs aren't always a bad thing. And then the other 160 basis points or so is increased costs related to our personnel. But as we've talked, Simon, again, we're still very comfortable that everything will eventually normalizes out in that 70-ish percent range. And there's some seasonality in there here and there. But overall, we think we'll ultimately get to that low 70% range.\\nSome of that personnel cost was related to some of the vehicles that couldn't be delivered that Randall spoke to earlier.\\nYes.\\nAs far as gross is down.\\nProbably, say, 4 million or 5 million of gross that we didn't get. We're up 3 million growth for the quarter year-over-year, where we lost  4 million, 5 million in that one. And then of course, we had a higher cost. The only thing we've really talked about with the hailstorm. And there's other little things in there where we just don't talk about at this point.\\nGot it. That's clear. And then just in the U.K., any updated learnings from the Mercedes agency model. Looks like the GPU actually went up sequentially there from 2Q to 3Q. What drove that? Any other learnings you can share on profitability, SG&A changes, et cetera?\\nYes, I'm talking about...\\nYes, sure. Yes, you're right, Rajat, the gross profit has gone up. And again, with a fixed commission, that's going to be predicated on the sell price of the car. So we were at 3,278, so GBP 3,278 per unit, which was up. If I look at 2019, it was GBP 2,595 pounds per unit. Interestingly, in the acquisition we made about a year ago, the London stores, that's at GBP 3,564 per unit. So you get that richer mix of car. Obviously, we get the benefit from that. So our challenge and what the team has done a nice job and continues to do is we just got to reduce our cost base as we have a bit of a paradigm shift in how the customers transact. \\nYou see the traffic -- foot traffic into the stores down, but our digital, our Internet traffic is way up. So it's really trying to convert, and we've improved our conversion ratio on those leads by 8 points year-to-date compared to last year. So that's the kind of stuff we're working on. We see Service and Parts continue to be strong there and grow. So look, those margins are good. We just got to continue to work on those costs underneath and drive those opportunities to the store, both digitally and walking in.\\nI think the good news here is that -- we were the first guys in the barrel with agency. We're shifting to more product specialists than salespeople, which lower our cost. We're getting a lot more inquiries by significantly higher than we had before because 95% are coming out of our PMA as we call it over here, which is a real positive. We've got 13,000 vehicles that are on site from the standpoint that the customer can look at. They've given us now some stock cars, which we didn't have at the beginning and there's some incentive to sell off the floor. \\nSo it's very interesting. We had no idea interest rates are going to go over there. We're complained about agency. But I can tell you one thing, we have no cost and they're paying for our marketing cost to a certain extent. So I think our understanding of our cost base, the fixed margin, which is good. By the way, on BEVs, getting an extra 100 basis points, correct on that. \\nSo I would say that at the moment, we're learning, and I'm certainly Mercedes is learning too. Now they backed up a little bit, we understand other parts of Europe where they were going to introduce it, they're pushing it back because they're learning a lot about what's going on in the U.K. So it might be a little bit about like BEV. overnight, they're going to say we're going that way everywhere. So I think we've got many coming up next year, and we'll see in '26 we have BMW, but we're all over it.\\nNext, we go to the line of John Healy.\\nRoger, I just wanted to ask just kind of early thoughts in the last month or so on just the UAW impact maybe on the industry as a whole. Obviously, I know you guys have minimal exposure to the big 3, but part of me feels like there is a [indiscernible] if someone is looking for an Explorer, they might be looking for a CRB as well or something along those lines. So any sort of thought about grosses in Q4. \\nDo you think that there's a magic number in terms of the strike last for so long that maybe it has a little bit of a sequential bump on grosses. And do you subscribe to a theory that the strike ends up maybe taking margins higher in the short run when we start next year maybe at a higher level than maybe where we're at today.\\nThis is one time when I read the paper, it doesn't affect us because when you look at our brand mix, we only have 1% of our total revenue comes out of big 3. And Toyota, Honda, we're not at this point affected and most of the German brands are already dealing with their unions that they have overseas. But look, having owned Detroit Diesel and adding UAW look, what's happening is they see all these profits the union does and the workers. And I think the unfortunate thing is that there's a cost base that has been put in place which is much higher than the competition. \\nAnd that's the biggest concern I think they have, and they're trying to mitigate that with good negotiations with the Big 3. And with [indiscernible] with new hires coming in and melding into the top rate instead of 6 years, 3 or 4 years, all these things are probably ways that you can kind of get together. But I don't think we've seen the last page of this. And unfortunately, it's going to put higher cost for the Big 3, and I'm glad where we are with our brand mix.\\nGot it. And you brought up Toyota. I think in the last couple of days, there was an issue with one of Toyota's [indiscernible] suppliers. Does that have any sort of meaningful or risk to you guys in Q4 or 1Q of next year? Have they communicated anything to be aware of on just their production outlook?\\nWell, look, what's our debt base imply, Well, look, what's our debt base imply, 10 or 12 days, [indiscernible] less than 10. Yes. look, if they get an issue with a supplier, obviously, for the U.S. plants, stuff comes out of different parts of the world for them, it could impact us for sure.\\nAnd our next question is from David Whiston.\\nA couple of questions. First, I think Shelly, you were talking earlier about the example of customer booking a new X5, you could get -- sell them one of your loaner as a use. I guess my question on that would be, how quickly can you then replenish that loaner.\\nWell, I think that's what we're seeing today. Everybody is looking at our used cars. I said, look, we were hampered by not being able to turn loaners. We turn loaners typically in 90 to 120 days. Now that supply is coming we're going to suck up some of that availability in the loaner cars. So it's all going to be done by based on availability. But in the premium luxury side, it's really key because I can turn that 21,000 loaners 3 times a year, that's -- really that's 21,000 more used cars. \\nBut I think we fill the pipeline based on the individual OEM. Maybe that's not what you want, but that's kind of what my thoughts are.\\nAnd our loaner cars were up about 10%, at least from what they were.\\nYes.\\n[indiscernible].\\nSo that's a big change, and that's going to help drive more of the used vehicle turn for the business.\\nThink about it, David, you have an MSRP and you say we depreciate the vehicles at 2% per month. Some higher, some lower than say, 2%, so you get 6% off of invoice. And typically, the new car programs, whether it's financing or whatever it is, go along on this vehicle that's coming out of loaners as long as it has a certain limited number of miles. So we get newer car rates, we have a depreciated vehicle, we take a customer that didn't want to step up maybe to the X5 what have you, we can give an X3, it's a loaner car with a lower cost base.\\nAnd the OEMs want us to have these service loaners. So we're incentivized to have them.\\nWe're also starting to see a return of CPO business, too, because of the CPO business, certified preowned used sales are up year-over-year because of -- because we're having more availability.\\nWe got our other impact we've had is lease returns. We hadn't been a lot of leasing. So leasing went down to 21%, I think, overall, right?  In the premium/luxury side, we were high 55% in some months.\\n5\\nAnd we were 27% leasing this past quarter.\\nI'm sorry, what was your leasing penetration this quarter?\\n27% leasing this past quarter. That's up from 24% a year ago, David.\\nYou said that was up from '20, Tony?\\nFrom '21.\\n'21. And then going back to the EV discussion from a few minutes ago. What is your team's opinion on especially next year once a lot of OEMs get access to the Tesla Supercharger network. And over time, we get more non-Tesla charging outlets out there in the U.S. Do you think that's enough to get EV demand moving? Or do we also need a lot more affordable models? Or is it still just way too early for EVs?\\nWell, I think you've hit on a couple of different things. I think the price points right now are still substantially higher with certain models than compared to ICE. And so when you combine that with the interest rate environment we're in, that's problematic. So that's one thing that hurts the demand for EVs. \\nRoger talked about the infrastructure. So you've got the charging network that's out there from a public standpoint, you got about 20% success rate of the charger being successful when you pull into it, which is pretty alarming when you think about it. So that reduces the confidence, still got the range anxiety. And then I think as it relates to all these other OEMs signing up on Tesla's charging network, I'm interested to see how that plays out with the Tesla owners today because obviously, that was a network that was exclusive to them at some -- at one point. Now it's been opened up to everybody else. I don't know off the top of my head how many additional chargers Tesla is installing on a monthly basis as to whether or not they'll keep up with this. Additional brands and other OEM EVs that have access to that network now. \\nBut if I'm a Tesla owner, that would upset me a little bit. I had this proprietary network to the vehicle that I purchased that gave me some assurances that charging was going to be more convenient. Now I've got to compete with all these other OEMs on the same network. So I think it's going to be a while before we get to a critical mass where the charging infrastructure really supports mass adoption of the vehicles.\\nAnd David, if it helps, you heard Randall's penetration numbers on EVs in the U.K., and it almost gives us a preview of what it's like in the U.S. And over in the U.K., I can tell you they still have the same range anxiety. They still have the broken chargers. So even despite a much higher EV penetration, there's still that range anxiety and those issues with the infrastructure. So it may help next year, but I don't think it's also a problem.\\nAnd we have no other questions. I will turn the conference back over to Mr. Penske for closing remarks.\\nAll right. Thanks, everybody, for joining us. We'll see you at the end of the next quarter. Have a great day.\\nLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.
